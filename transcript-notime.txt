FROM WITH PAT HEALY, FROM VERDE DESIGN, AND ON ZOOM WE HAVE CHIP TAYLOR, DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC WORKS. IN CASE THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS RELATING TO PUBLIC WORKS
BEFORE WE START THE PRESENTATION, I'D LIKE TO SET THE STAGE A LITTLE BIT ON WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE TONIGHT. WE'RE HERE TO REPORT BACK ON THE FINDINGS FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF NEEDS FOR ADDITIONAL OUTDOOR SPORTS PROGRAMS AND FACILITIES. THE STUDY ISSUE. I'D LIKE TO JUST READ A LITTLE BIT A FEW LINES FROM THE STUDY ISSUE. JUST SO WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE. WHAT PRECIPITATED THIS STUDY SHIFTS IN SUNNYVALE'S RESIDENT DEMOGRAPHICS AND DIVERSITY RELATIVE TO YOUTH, OLDER ADULTS AND NATIONAL ORIGIN
HAVE LED TO AN INCREASED DEMAND FOR CERTAIN OUTDOOR SPORTS, ESPECIALLY PICKLEBALL, TENNIS AND CRICKET.
THESE ACTIVITIES PROVIDE RESIDENTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR FAVORABLE YEAR-ROUND WEATHER WHILE PROVIDING EXERCISE THROUGHOUT THE SOCIAL AND COMPETITIVE PLAY.
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO BE A HOTBED OF ACTIVITY, FOR TENNIS. PICKLEBALL IS GROWING RAPIDLY IN THE NEIGHBORING SOUTH BAY CITIES, AND CRICKET IS GAINING IN POPULARITY.
THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY IS TO CONSIDER CURRENT RECREATION TRENDS AND COMMUNITY NEEDS RELATIVE TO CERTAIN OUTDOOR SPORTS, ESPECIALLY PICKLEBALL, TENNIS AND CRICKET. SO WITH THAT, WE DO HAVE A PRESENTATION HERE FOR YOU TONIGHT THAT WILL OUTLINE THE SURVEY RESULTS. THE COMMUNITY MEETING THE PARKS AND REC MEETING.
AND AT THE END WE WILL BE LOOKING FOR YOUR INPUT AS WE TRY AND MOVE FORWARD. SO I'D LIKE TO TURN THAT OVER NOW TO PAT.
THANK YOU, MICHELLE, FOR THE INTRODUCTION.
IF WE CAN QUEUE UP THE POWERPOINT. THANK YOU.
SO WE HAVE SOME TEAM MEMBERS HERE THAT WERE INVOLVED IN THE SPORTS ASSESSMENT, INCLUDING TRACY, GOTT. NEXT TO ME, RECREATION SERVICE MANAGER, MICHELLE PEREIRA, WHO INTRODUCED HERSELF AND VERONICA VERONICA TORRES RECREATION COORDINATOR WITH LRS
REPRESENTING VERDE DESIGN MY NAME IS PAT HEALY, AN ASSOCIATE AND PROJECT MANAGER. MARK BEGINSKI IS A PRINCIPAL WITH US WHO COULDN'T BE HERE TONIGHT, BUT HE
ASK FOR YOUR FORGIVENESS FOR NOT BEING HERE.
AND WE WERE HIRED BY THE CITY OF SUNNYVALE TO PERFORM THE SPORTS ASSESSMENT.
AS MICHELLE MENTIONED SOME OF THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THE STUDY LEADING TO THIS ASSESSMENT WERE TO CONSIDER CURRENT RECREATION TRENDS AND COMMUNITY NEEDS RELATIVE TO CERTAIN OUTDOOR SPORTS, ESPECIALLY PICKLEBALL TENNIS AND CRICKET.
LOOKING AT PROGRAMS AND FACILITIES IN NEIGHBORING CITIES AND ENGAGING THE CITY OF SUNNYVALE COMMUNITY THROUGH SURVEYS, NEEDS, ASSESSMENTS, OUTREACH MEETINGS RELATIVE TO THESE ACTIVITIES.
AND INCLUDING THE CURRENT FACILITY, USE AND DEMAND WITH LONG RANGE PARK CAPITAL PROJECTS AND CONSIDERING FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE POTENTIAL TO IMPACT LAND USE AND SERVICE DELIVERY FOR THESE EMERGING RECREATION NEEDS
SOME OF THE KEY ASPECTS OF OUR ASSESSMENT PROJECT INCLUDE THE COMMUNITY OUTREACH TO HELP US DETERMINE PREFERENCES FOR THOSE TOP 3 FACILITIES.
REVIEWING SITES WITHIN THE EXISTING PARK SYSTEM TO ASSESS FEASIBILITY FOR ACCOMMODATING THESE FACILITIES WITHIN THEM.
AND FINALLY MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR LOCAL, FOR LOCATIONS OF THE PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS AND PROVIDING ROUGH ORDER OF MAGNITUDE COST ANALYSES FOR THOSE
IMPROVEMENTS.
THE EXPECTED OUTCOME OF THIS PRESENTATION IS FOR CITY COUNCIL TO REVIEW OUR RECOMMENDATIONS AND OUR PROCESS FROM WHICH WE DERIVED THEM. WE WILL HIGHLIGHT THE INPUT THAT WE RECEIVED FROM THE PARKS AND REC COMMISSION
AND WE'LL ALSO ASK FOR YOU TO PROVIDE FURTHER INPUT ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO BE FACTORED INTO OUR FINAL REPORT.
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ALL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL OUTREACH, ADDITIONAL DESIGN SERVICES, AND INPUT AGAIN FROM PRC. AND CITY COUNCIL BEFORE
TAKING SHAPE.
SO A LITTLE BIT OF A FLOW CHART OF WHERE WE STARTED FROM AND WHERE WE ARE NOW, WE HAD A HEAVY COMMUNITY OUTREACH PROCESS THAT STARTED WITH ENGAGEMENT WITH THE COMMUNITY FROM 2 ONLINE SURVEYS AND ONE COMMUNITY MEETING.
WE WERE PERFORMING SITE ANALYSIS OF EXISTING SUNNYVALE PARKS WITH SITE VISITS TO SITE VISITS TO PERFORM OUR INVENTORY AND ANALYSIS.
WE IDENTIFIED POTENTIAL SITES WITHIN THESE PARKS BASED ON EXISTING FACILITIES, SPATIAL, AVAILABLE SPACE AND SUPPORT AMENITIES.
CIRCLING BACK TO THE COMMUNITY FOR A SECOND COMMUNITY MEETING, AND THEN FINALLY
SOLIDIFYING OUR RECOMMENDATIONS INTO AN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY, WITH RECOMMENDATIONS, LOCATIONS, AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXECUTION OF THESE PROJECTS WITHIN THE PARK 20 YEAR PLAN, FUTURE
CIP IMPROVEMENTS.
SO WE STARTED WITH THE COMMUNITY INPUT PROCESS WHICH HAD 2 PARTS TO IT. FIRST, ST OFF CITY STAFF PERFORMED ENGAGEMENT WITH OTHER BAY AREA CITIES.
WE ALSO PERFORMED, PERFORMED A COMMUNITY SURVEY
HELD FROM JUNE THROUGH SEPTEMBER, WHICH HAD 5 VERY SIMPLE QUESTIONS, AND WE HAD A GREAT RESPONSE OF 2,283 RESPONSES.
THE 1ST PART OF THE ENGAGEMENT WAS WITH OTHER BAY AREA CITIES, AND I MENTIONED CITY STAFF REACHED OUT TO LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES AROUND THE BAY
TO GET A GAUGE FOR THE NUMBER OF PICKLEBALL FACILITIES, BOTH INDOOR AND OUTDOOR, SO THAT WE HAD A A BASIS FOR WHICH TO IDENTIFY HOW MANY SUNNYVALE MAY NEED
IN GENERAL, THEY ALL WERE AROUND THAT 10. THE MEDIAN WAS 8 COURTS PER CITY, INCLUDING BOTH INDOOR AND OUTDOOR.
THE OUTLIER WAS SAN JOSE, WHICH HAS A MUCH HIGHER POPULATION, SO IT MAKES SENSE THAT IT HAS HIGHER COURT QUANTITIES.
WE ALSO IDENTIFIED.
IF THERE IS A COST TO PLAY
30% HAD FREE DROP-IN RATES, BUT 60,
65%. EXCUSE ME, 70% REQUIRED CLASS RATES OR OR MEMBERSHIP
VERSUS FREE AND THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO IDENTIFY IN THIS STUDY WAS OPPORTUNITIES FOR FREE
FACILITY. USAGE CLASSES ARE OFFERED AT 55% OF THOSE THAT WE POLLED.
64% DO NOT REQUIRE RESERVATIONS AND 75% HAVE NETTING. THAT'S PROVIDED BY THE CITY, WHICH IS SOMETHING WE'LL SHARE WHEN WE GET INTO THE FACILITY DESIGN.
THE COMMUNITY SURVEY, WHICH WAS HELD WITH 5 MAIN QUESTIONS, HAD 2 QUESTIONS THAT WE'RE GOING TO SHARE TONIGHT THE 1ST ONE, WHEN ASKED WHICH OUTDOOR SPORTS AND OUR ACTIVITIES YOU CURRENTLY PARTICIPATE IN AT A SUNNYVALE PARK. THE TOP 3 WERE TENNIS, SOCCER AND PICKLEBALL.
BUT THE MOST RELEVANT QUESTION TO OUR STUDY WAS THIS QUESTION WHICH ASKED, WHAT SPORTS OR ACTIVITIES WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE EXPANDED OR ADDED TO SUNNYVALE PARKS. THE TOP 3 RESPONSES WERE PICKLEBALL, CRICKET, AND TENNIS.
SO THAT HELPED US NARROW DOWN WHERE WE WOULD FOCUS OUR EFFORTS
TO IDENTIFY LOCATIONS FOR THESE FACILITIES. WHICH FOLLOWED
FOLLOWS INTO OUR FACILITY DESIGN. SECTION
WITH THESE TOP 3 IN DEMAND SPORTS, WE LOOKED AT THE SPATIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR EACH AND
WHERE THEY COULD POTENTIALLY FIT WITHIN CITY OF SUNNYVALE PARKS. AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT PARKS SPECIFICALLY
TENNIS AND PICKLEBALL COURTS.
THE CITY HAS A TOTAL OF 12 LOCATIONS WITH TENNIS COURTS THE TENNIS CENTER HAS PICKLEBALL.
10 OF THEM HAVE LIGHTED COURTS. WE ALSO LOOKED AT THE POTENTIAL FOR COURTS TO BE RESTRIPED, TENNIS COURTS TO BE RESTRIPED TO INCLUDE PICKLEBALL.
AND IN A SUMMARY OF OUR ANALYSIS WE IDENTIFIED 8 POTENTIAL LOCATIONS FOR PICKLEBALL, OVERLAY, AND OR NEW TENNIS OR PICKLEBALL FACILITIES.
ONE WAS AT DE ANZA PARK, WHERE THERE CURRENTLY AREN'T EXISTING TENNIS AND PICKLEBALL
SOME IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS WE MADE WERE
THE PICKLEBALL GENERATES MORE SOUND THAN TENNIS. THAT WAS SOMETHING WE WERE CONSIDERATE OF.
ALSO, LOOKING AT THE PROXIMITY TO ADJACENT RESIDENCES, SO THAT THAT NOISE GENERATION WASN'T A FACTOR.
AND IN GENERAL, PICKLEBALL AND TENNIS HAVE DIFFERENT SOCIAL ENVIRONMENTS. SO ALTHOUGH THEY ARE BOTH COURT SPORTS WITH A NET AND PADDLES, THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY 100% COMPATIBLE WITH THE SOCIAL AND COMPETITIVE ASPECT OF THE GAMES.
SIDE BY SIDE, LOOKING AT THE COURT DIMENSIONS, PICKLEBALL IS ROUGHLY 20 BY 44 FEET.
AND TENNIS IS 78 BY 36, WITH THE DOUBLES, ALLEYS ON THE EITHER SIDE.
AND THESE ARE DICTATED BY THE USTA TENNIS ASSOCIATION AND U.S.A. PICKLEBALL STANDARDS.
THEY.
WE LOOKED AT THE POTENTIAL FOR OVERLAYING WHICH, AS WE SAW FROM THE CITY
ADJACENT CITY OUTREACH. SOME OF THEM ARE OVERLAID ON EXISTING COURTS. AND YOU SEE THIS AT THE SUNNYVALE TENNIS CENTER
CONFIGURATION NUMBER ONE, WHERE YOU CAN NEST PICKLEBALL COURTS WITHIN A TENNIS COURT. THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME NET HEIGHT, SO YOU CAN'T
SHARE THAT NET.
BUT THIS GIVES AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF SPACE WITHIN THOSE
WITH THOSE EXISTING TENNIS COURTS, IF YOU SHOULD CHOOSE, SO
THE LOCATIONS WOULD BE DEPENDENT ON LIGHTING AND FENCING, AND BOTH OPTIONS WOULD REQUIRE PORTABLE NETTING FOR CRICKET, OR EXCUSE ME FOR PICKLEBALL.
WE ALSO LOOKED AT OVERLAYING PICKLEBALL ON BASKETBALL COURTS, AND A COUPLE CONFIGURATIONS ARE SHOWN HERE. THESE ARE ALSO CONTINGENT ON LIGHTING AVAILABLE LIGHTING AND FENCING, AS PICKLEBALL. YOU WANT SURROUNDING FENCING TO CONTAIN THE BALLS.
BUT THESE ARE SOME OPTIONS THAT WE ENTERTAINED
IN GENERATING A SPATIAL LAYOUT AND SOME COST ESTIMATING, WE DEVELOPED AN EXAMPLE. PICKLEBALL COURT DESIGN WHICH IS SHOWN HERE, AND I'LL LIST SOME OF THE MAIN COMPONENTS THAT WE INCLUDED. WE HAVE LED COURT LIGHTING PLAYER, SPECTATOR, BENCHES.
PERIMETER, VINYL, COATED CHAIN, LINK, FENCING.
PICKLEBALL, NETTING, WE INCLUDED SOUND, DAMPENING WINDSCREEN ON OUR COST, ESTIMATING FOR THE FOR THE FENCING SO WE COULD KEEP THE NOISE AT BAY.
AND ALSO PERIMETER PATHWAYS TO GET IN AND OUT
LOOKING AT AN EXAMPLE. TENNIS COURT DESIGN. THERE'S A LOT OF THE SAME COMPONENTS. WE HAVE LED COURT LIGHTING PLAYER, SPECTATOR BENCHES.
THE VINYL COATED CHAIN LINK FENCING WITH A TYPICAL WINDSCREEN JUST TO KEEP THE SUN OUT AND WIND OUT
PERMANENT TENNIS NETTING AND A PERIMETER PATHWAY. SO THESE ARE KIND OF THE MODULES THAT WE USE TO LOOK AT WHERE THESE COULD FIT.
WE ALSO EXPLORED THE EXISTING CRICKET FIELDS WITHIN THE PARK SYSTEM OF SUNNYVALE.
CURRENTLY 2 PARKS IN SUNNYVALE, FAIR OAKS AND ORTEGA HAVE EXISTING FACILITIES. BOTH HAVE LIGHTS WITHIN THEM.
FAIR OAKS HAS LIGHTS AROUND THE ENTIRE FIELD. ORTEGA DOESN'T NECESSARILY COVER THE ENTIRE CRICKET FIELD. SO THAT COMES WITH THE CAVEAT
IN OUR REVIEW OF THE POTENTIAL NEW OR IMPROVED CRICKET FIELD LOCATIONS. WE IDENTIFIED 6 LOCATIONS SHOWN HERE IN GREEN.
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTICE THAT CRICKET DOES REQUIRE A PRETTY LARGE FOOTPRINT.
AND THE PREFERRED PREFERRED PITCH SURFACE FOR CRICKET MAY NOT BE COMPATIBLE WITH OTHER ADJACENT SPORTS SURFACES.
LOOKING AT THE CRICKET FIELD DIMENSIONS.
THE ON THE LEFT, YOU CAN SEE A CRICKET ADULT PITCH, WHICH IS THE ABBREVIATION. CA, THE PITCH ITSELF IS THE GREEN RECTANGLE IN THE MIDDLE, WHICH HAS ABOUT 66 FEET BETWEEN THE CREASE LINES AND AN 8 FOOT WIDE, PITCH
10 FOOT WIDE, PITCH WITH A FIELD DIAMETER OF 360 FEET. WITH THE CRICKET, THE YOUTH CRICKET ON THE RIGHT SIDE, A FIELD DIAMETER OF 330 FEET.
AN EXAMPLE. CRICKET FIELD DESIGN THAT WE USE TO HELP GENERATE SOME OF OUR COSTS. YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S OVERLAID WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF AN EXISTING MULTI-USE FIELD.
WE INCLUDED LED FIELD LIGHTING, WHICH WOULD BE SHARED WITH ADJACENT USES. IN THIS CASE WE HAVE SOFTBALL
AND THIS IS JUST AN EXAMPLE AT LAS PALMAS PARK, WHICH WE'LL SHOW IN OUR RECOMMENDATION SECTION.
THE CRICKET PITCH IN THE CENTER WITH NATURAL GRASS CRICKET FIELD.
THAT WOULD BE A SHARED FEATURE WITH THE SOFTBALL OUTFIELD AND POTENTIALLY SOCCER IF IT WERE OUT THERE.
AND ALL OF THAT TO FIT WITHIN THE EXISTING NATURAL GRASS. MULTI-USE FIELD.
AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE LIGHTING WOULD WORK. FOR EXAMPLE, AT LAS PALMAS.
I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN ZOOM IN ON THIS A LITTLE BIT. IT'S KIND OF HARD TO SEE, BUT WE HAVE, LIKE AN 8 POLE LAYOUT
AT LAS PALMAS, WHERE THE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH WHERE THE THE LIGHTING SYMBOLS HERE WOULD OPERATE. IF YOU CAN PAN DOWN JUST A LITTLE BIT TO THE THE CIRCLE ON THE UPPER LEFT OF WHERE WE ARE HERE.
THANK YOU.
YOU CAN SEE THE THE LIGHT POLES THERE IDENTIFY
THE LIGHTING FOR CRICKET, BUT IS ALSO SHARED WITH THE ADJACENT BASEBALL SOFTBALL FIELD AS AN EXAMPLE LAYOUT.
AND THEN WE'LL GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE.
WHICH HAS A POTENTIAL LIGHTING SCHEME FOR ORTEGA PARK.
AND IN THIS CASE, AGAIN, WE'RE SHARING THE THE LIGHTING AS A
AN AMENITY THAT SUPPORTS BOTH THE CRICKET FIELD, BUT ALSO BASEBALL AND SOFTBALL ON THE DIAGONAL CORNERS OF THAT FIELD.
SO AS WE DEVELOPED THE BASIS FOR OUR DESIGN OF EACH FACILITY, WE CONTINUED TO REACH OUT TO THE COMMUNITY TO HELP DETERMINE OPTIMAL LOCATIONS FOR THESE FACILITIES.
BY THE TIME WE GOT TO THE SECOND COMMUNITY MEETING WE HAD 79 PARTICIPANTS.
AND THAT WAS SHORTLY FOLLOWED BY A COMMUNITY SURVEY NUMBER 2, WHICH HAD 7 QUESTIONS, AND WE RECEIVED 700 1,704 RESPONSES.
THIS
MEETING AND THE SURVEY, WE TOOK THE TOP 3 SPORTS AND POSED QUESTIONS TO THE COMMUNITY TO HELP US GET FEEDBACK ON THE PROPOSED LOCATIONS THAT WE HAD IDENTIFIED FROM OUR
FACILITY STUDY AND OUR SITE ASSESSMENT.
WHEN ASKED AT THE SURVEY AND MEETING. IF PEOPLE WERE INTERESTED IN A PICKLEBALL OVERLAY ON EXISTING COURTS, THE GENERAL CONSENSUS WAS THAT NO, IT WAS NOT A FAVORABLE OUTCOME.
AND WE DID ASK WHICH PARKS WOULD YOU SUPPORT ADDING PICKLEBALL, STRIPING TO EXISTING TENNIS COURTS? THE TOP ANSWER WAS NONE OF THE ABOVE. WITH SARAH PARK AND ORTEGA PARK
AS RUNNERS UP.
WHEN ASKED ABOUT TENNIS AND PICKLEBALL FACILITIES, WE IDENTIFIED 6 PARK LOCATIONS WHICH WERE SUITABLE FOR
EITHER DEDICATED PICKLEBALL, DEDICATED TENNIS OR SHARED USE FACILITY AND POSE THE QUESTION TO THE COMMUNITY AS TO WHICH WOULD BE THEIR PREFERRED.
IN GENERAL, THE SHARED USE OPTION WAS NOT PREFERRED, WHICH IS THAT 3RD COLUMN ON THE RIGHT.
THE DEDICATED FACILITIES WERE THE PREFERRED OPTION
FOR PICKLEBALL. THE TOP CHOICE WAS DE ANZA.
RUNNER UP OF LAS PALMAS, AND 3RD WAS PONDEROSA PARK FOR A PICKLEBALL ONLY FACILITY, AND
FOR TENNIS. WE HAD LAS PALMAS PARK IN FIRST, ST DE ANZA SECOND, AND PONDEROSA 3.RD
WHEN ASKED ABOUT PICKLEBALL OVERLAY ON EXISTING BASKETBALL COURTS. WE HAD A MORE POSITIVE RESPONSE.
WITH MOST PEOPLE RESPONDING. YES, THEY WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF ADDING PICKLEBALL, STRIPING TO EXISTING BASKETBALL COURTS.
WE IDENTIFIED 3 POTENTIAL LOCATIONS, AND THE TOP 3 WERE ORTEGA, WASHINGTON, AND FAIR OAKS. IN THAT ORDER.
WHEN THE QUESTION ABOUT NEW OR IMPROVED CRICKET FACILITIES WAS ASKED. THE TOP RESPONSES WERE
THE TOP RESPONSE WAS NONE OF THE ABOVE, AND WE ATTRIBUTE THAT TO POTENTIALLY OTHER USER GROUPS WHO WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE
LIMITATION OF THEIR THEIR PREFERRED FACILITY OF CRICKET TAKING THAT OVER.
BUT WE DID HAVE POSITIVE RESPONSES FOR LAS PALMAS PARK AND ORTEGA PARK FOR ADDING OR IMPROVING THE CRICKET FACILITIES.
SO ALL OF THIS WENT KIND OF IN TANDEM WITH OUR SITE ASSESSMENT WHICH HELPED US IDENTIFY THOSE
POTENTIAL LOCATIONS WHERE WE WHICH WE ASKED THE PUBLIC ABOUT
THIS PARK ASSESSMENT WAS AN EVALUATION OF ALL SUNNYVALE PARKS, WHICH HAS A TOTAL OF 772 ACRES, RANGING IN SIZE, FROM NEIGHBORHOOD TO REGIONAL SCALE.
THE ASSESSMENTS WERE BASED ON AVAILABLE SPACE EXISTING FACILITIES AND AVAILABLE AMENITIES, SUCH AS PARKING, LIGHTING, AND RESTROOMS.
WE PERFORMED AN OBJECTIVE CHECKLIST TO HELP US NARROW DOWN SOME OF OUR SEARCH QUERIES. THIS IS JUST A SNAPSHOT OF SOME OF THE THE INVENTORY THAT WE TOOK, IDENTIFYING WHERE WE HAD EXISTING BASEBALL, SOFTBALL, BASKETBALL.
BUT ALSO LIGHTING OFF STREET PARKING AND RESTROOMS, WHICH WAS A MAJOR FACTOR IN OUR DETERMINATION.
WE'RE GOING TO ZOOM IN ON THE SITE ASSESSMENT FOR THE 6 PARKS THAT WERE PART OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. AND I'LL KIND OF WALK YOU THROUGH THAT PROCESS.
AT DE ANZA PARK. WE IDENTIFIED IT AS A
POTENTIAL HAVING A POTENTIAL AREA FOR NEW PICKLEBALL AND OR TENNIS COURTS.
WITH ACCESSIBLE PATHS TO THE LOCATION SHOWN IN GREEN. HERE,
AND THERE WAS AVAILABLE SUPPORT AND AMENITIES, SUCH AS PARKING OFF STREET PARKING, RESTROOMS, AND
THAT HELPED US TO MAKE THE RECOMMENDATION ALONG WITH THE PUBLIC THAT WE WOULD PROPOSE TO ADD DEDICATED PICKLEBALL COURTS AT DE ANZA. THIS WAS RANKED 1ST IN PREFERRED LOCATION FOR DEDICATED PICKLEBALL COURTS.
WE'VE IDENTIFIED. THERE'S A POTENTIAL FOR UP TO 12 PICKLEBALL COURTS IN THE LOCATION SHOWN IN GREEN.
AND IT HAS, AS I MENTIONED, ACCESS TO THE EXISTING SITE, PATHWAYS, RESTROOMS, AND OFF STREET PARKING.
WE LOOKED AT ENSIGNAL PARK, WHICH IS UP IN NORTHWEST SUNNYVALE. IT HAS EXISTING TENNIS COURTS, WHICH WERE A POTENTIAL LOCATION FOR PICKLEBALL OVERLAY, BUT WE ALSO IDENTIFIED AS A PART OF THE EXISTING FIELD FOR
POTENTIAL NEW TENNIS AND OR PICKLEBALL COURTS, AND OUR RECOMMENDATIONS SHOW THAT WE WOULD RECOMMEND ADDING DEDICATED PICKLEBALL COURTS AT ENCINDALL PARK. THIS WAS RANKED 4TH IN PREFERRED LOCATIONS. IT HAS SPACE FOR UP TO 6 COURTS.
WITH ACCESS TO THE EXISTING RESTROOMS AND PATHWAYS.
IT DOESN'T HAVE AUSTRIA PARKING, BUT THERE ARE. IT IS SURROUNDED BY MULTIFAMILY HOUSING AND OFFICES WHICH WE FELT WAS SUITABLE FOR THIS LOCATION.
AT PONDEROSA PARK WE IDENTIFIED SOME EXISTING SPACE FOR POTENTIAL NEW TENNIS AND OUR PICKLEBALL COURTS. THERE ARE EXISTING TENNIS COURTS ON THE SITE, BUT THEY'RE TOO CLOSE TO THE ADJACENT RESIDENCES FOR US TO RECOMMEND THE POTENTIAL FOR STRIPING OVERLAY.
BUT WE IDENTIFIED A LOCATION FOR POTENTIAL NEW
PICKLEBALL OR TENNIS COURTS AND FROM THE COMMUNITY. INPUT
THIS WAS 3RD PLACE FOR PREFERRED
TENNIS COURTS, SO OUR RECOMMENDATION IS TO ADD DEDICATED TENNIS COURTS AT PONDEROSA.
THERE'S SPACE FOR UP TO 2 TENNIS COURTS, AND IT HAS ACCESS TO THE NEARBY PATHWAYS, RESTROOMS, AND OFF STREET PARKING.
WE ALSO LOOKED AT LAS PALMAS PARK, WHICH IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT IT'S CURRENTLY IN DESIGN.
IT HAS A LARGE MULTI-USE FIELD WHICH HAD AN AVAILABLE SPACE FOR AN ADULT CRICKET FIELD
AND ALSO POTENTIAL SPACE FOR DEDICATED TENNIS AND OR PICKLEBALL
FROM THE RESULTS OF THE SURVEY WE IDENTIFIED THAT
THE DEDIC, THE TENNIS COURTS WERE THE FIRST, ST
THE PREFERRED LOCATION. THE RANKED 1ST PREFERRED LOCATION FOR ADDING
TENNIS AND CRICKET. SO WE'RE PROPOSING TO ADD A DEDICATED TENNIS COURTS AT LAS PALMAS PARK.
AND A NEW CRICKET PITCH FACILITY AT LAS PALMAS PARK, AS SHOWN HERE.
AT ORTEGA PARK. WE IDENTIFIED THAT THERE'S AN EXISTING CRICKET PITCH WHICH IS
NOT IN GREAT SHAPE, AS YOU CAN
IMAGINE. AND YOU WOULD, WHICH WE HEARD ALSO IN OUR
COMMUNITY OUTPUT, AND FROM THE PRC MEETING
WE IDENTIFIED AS A POTENTIAL LOCATION FOR AN IMPROVED CRICKET FACILITY.
WE ALSO IDENTIFIED ON THE BASKETBALL COURTS THAT THOSE WERE A POTENTIAL LOCATION FOR PICKLEBALL STRIPING, AS SHOWN IN THE CENTER WITH THE BLUE CIRCLE
AND OUR RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE TO REFURBISH THE EXISTING CRICKET, PITCH, SLASH FIELD AT ORTEGA PARK.
AND IMPLEMENT NEW PICKLEBALL VIA THE OVERLAY ON EXISTING BASKETBALL COURTS.
AS I MENTIONED, IT WAS RANKED SECOND IN THE PREFERRED LOCATION FOR CRICKET, AND 1ST IN PREFERRED LOCATION FOR THE PICKLEBALL COURT OVERLAY ON BASKETBALL.
WASHINGTON PARK IS A LITTLE BIT OF A SMALLER PARK.
BUT WE DID IDENTIFY THE EXISTING BASKETBALL AS A POTENTIAL CANDIDATE FOR PICKLEBALL OVERLAY STRIPING WITH ROOM FOR UP TO 2 COURTS.
WE RECOMMEND NEW PICKLEBALL OVERLAY ON THE EXISTING BASKETBALL COURTS AT WASHINGTON. THIS WAS RANKED SECOND IN THE PREFERRED LOCATION FOR ADDING PICKLEBALL, STRIPING WITH SPACE FOR UP TO 2 COURTS.
AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WE DIDN'T MAX OUT 4 COURTS ON THIS LOCATION BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL NOISE
CREATION ON THE HOMES ACROSS WASHINGTON AVENUE.
SOME COST ANALYSIS PERFORMED. ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED TO HELP PREPARE, GIVE AN IDEA OF BUDGET FOR SOME OF THESE FACILITIES.
AND WE USE ROUGH ORDER OF MAGNITUDE. PRICING. THIS INCLUDES MOBILIZATION, PROJECT MANAGEMENT SURVEYS, PERMITS AND SWIT PLANS WITH CONTINGENCIES FOR DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION AND BIDDING INFLATION
IN GENERAL, THE PICKLEBALL AND TENNIS COST. ANALYSIS IS SHOWN HERE.
A TYPICAL PICKLEBALL COURT, WITH 6 COURTS AND LIGHTING, WOULD BE AROUND 1.1 MILLION.
THE PICKLEBALL OVERLAY ON EACH COURT, AS WE SHOWED AT WASHINGTON AND ORTEGA WOULD ABOUT BE ABOUT 60,000 PER COURT
TENNIS COURTS FOR 2 COURTS WITH LIGHTING WOULD BE ABOUT 1 POINT OH, 5 MILLION
CRICKET. WE BROKE DOWN A LITTLE BIT MORE, BECAUSE THERE'S IT'S A LITTLE MORE OF A NUANCED COST ESTIMATE
AS WE SHOWED IN SOME OF THE RENDERINGS.
A MAJORITY OF THE PITCH OF THE FIELD SURFACE WOULD BE A SHARED FACILITY WITH ADJACENT USES.
THE PITCH SURFACE ITSELF WOULD BE IN THE RANGE OF 30 TO $47,000,
BUT THE THE LARGE OUTFIELD AREA, WHICH IS 300 FOOT DIAMETER FOR THE THE ADULT FIELD, WOULD COST ABOUT 634,000 FOR THAT SITE. PREP AND DRAINAGE, PREPARATION.
AND THE NATURAL GRASS AND IRRIGATION STARTING FROM NEW SOD AND NEW MAINLINE AND ROTORS WOULD BE AROUND 890,000.
THERE'S A PRETTY BIG NUMBER HERE FOR THE CRICKET, ELECTRICAL AND LIGHTING, AND THIS AGAIN, IS SUPPORTING
AS A SHARED RESOURCE WITH ADJACENT FIELDS NOT SOLELY DEDICATED TO CRICKET.
BUT FOR SOME OF THOSE LARGER 8 POLE DESIGNS THAT WE SHARED, WHICH MAY REQUIRE A SERVICE UPGRADE FROM PG. AND E. AND TRENCHING PULL BOXES AND CONDUIT AND CONDUCTORS
YOU'RE LOOKING AT ANYWHERE BETWEEN 1.9 AND 2.6 MILLION FOR LIGHTING. SO ALL IN
THE THE CRICKET, SO TO SPEAK, WOULD BE 3.5 TO 4.2 MILLION, BUT A MAJORITY OF THAT WOULD BE SHARED WITH ADJACENT FACILITIES.
JUST TO DISTILL DOWN OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. AGAIN, WHICH I RAN THROUGH BRIEFLY IN OUR SITE ANALYSIS SECTION.
BASED ON THE DESIGN TEAM INPUT, AND COMMUNITY FEEDBACK. WE RECOMMEND ADDITIONAL COMMUNITY OUTREACH, AS THE CITY CONSIDERS AND PRIORITIZES IMPROVEMENTS AT THE FOLLOWING LOCATIONS AS PART OF UPCOMING BUDGET PROCESS AND FUTURE CIP PROJECTS
RECOMMENDATION. ONE DEDICATED PICKLEBALL COURTS AT DE ANZA PARK.
2. DEDICATED PICKLEBALL COURTS AT ENCINNALL PARK.
3. DEDICATED TENNIS COURTS AT LAS PALMAS PARK.
4 DEDICATED TENNIS, COURTS, AT PONDEROSA PARK.
5. NEW PICKLEBALL OVERLAY ON THE EXISTING BASKETBALL COURTS AT ORTEGA.
NUMBER 6, NEW PICKLEBALL OVERLAY ON EXISTING BASKETBALL COURTS AT WASHINGTON PARK.
NUMBER 7, NEW CRICKET PITCH FIELD AT LAS PALMAS PARK.
AND NUMBER 8 WOULD BE REFURBISH THE EXISTING CRICKET PITCH FIELD AT ORTEGA PARK.
WE'VE HIGHLIGHTED 2 OF THESE, NUMBER
4 AND 7. EXCUSE ME, 3 AND 7
TO CONSIDER AS PART OF UPCOMING THE LAS PALMAS PARK RENOVATION PROJECT, WHICH IS CURRENTLY IN DESIGN, AND THE REST WOULD BE RECOMMENDED TO CONSIDER AS CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS IN THE 20 YEAR CAPITAL PLAN.
WE PRESENTED THIS IN EARLY DECEMBER TO PRC. AND RECEIVED SOME FEEDBACK
IN GENERAL. THE PARKS AND REC. COMMISSION WAS ON BOARD. WITH OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. HOWEVER, THEY DID SUGGEST THAT RECOMMENDATIONS NUMBER 5 AND 6 REGARDING ADDING THE PICKLEBALL OVERLAY ON EXISTING BASKETBALL COURTS BE REMOVED.
SO THAT IS THE END OF OUR PRESENTATION. AND
WE, YOU KNOW, WE SHARED OUR RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON THE FEEDBACK THAT RECEIVED WE RECEIVED FROM THE COMMUNITY
AND IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL LOCATIONS FROM OUR SITE ASSESSMENT AND THE COMMUNITY INPUT. AND WE'D LIKE TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS AND GET YOUR FEEDBACK ON THE THE PROCESS ANY THOUGHTS YOU MIGHT HAVE.
OKAY, THANK YOU. STAFF.
SO NOW I'LL ASK MIKE
COLLEAGUES IF THEY HAVE QUESTIONS. WE HAVE ABOUT 30 MIN UNTIL OUR 7 PM. REGULAR SESSION. SO USE YOUR TIME ACCORDINGLY, AND WE STILL NEED TO HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT, TOO. SO WHY DON'T WE HEAR FROM MAYOR KLEIN FIRST.ST
THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION. GREAT TO SEE. YOU KNOW THE POLLING COMMUNITY OUTREACH THAT. THAT GOT US TO THIS POINT.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WAS HOPING TO SEE. HERE WAS A BREAKDOWN OF OUR CURRENT RESERVATIONS, SO NOT TO HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF THE USAGE THAT WE'RE ALREADY
ENABLING WITH WHAT WE HAVE. SO SO YOU KNOW DEFINITELY, THERE'S THE NEED FOR PICKLEBALL FOR FOR CRICKET OR SOCCER. I'LL SAY I WAS SURPRISED THAT THAT
LITTLE LEAGUE WASN'T HIGHER. AND ALL THIS BUT BUT HAVING THAT INFORMATION TO ME, THE ASSESSMENT NEEDS TO JUST NOT SAY IT'S LIKE THIS IS WHAT RESIDENTS WANT? BUT BUT WHAT'S THE USAGE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING RIGHT NOW? AND HOW MANY HOURS ARE WE GETTING OUT OF THAT? GOING HAND IN HAND WITH THAT, OF COURSE, FROM A NEEDS. ASSESSMENT STANDPOINT IS
WHAT? HOW MANY OF EACH THAT WE HAVE?
SO SO YOU KNOW, FROM PAGE 14 YOU HAD A REQUEST OF THIS IS WHAT WE WANT TO SEE, AND THIS IS WHAT WE WANT TO SEE EXPANDED.
WHAT ISN'T CAPTURED, AND MIGHT BE PART OF THE LARGER REPORT. THAT'S JUST NOT PART OF THIS PRESENTATION
IS, WE HAVE
10 OUTDOOR VOLLEYBALL COURTS. WE HAVE, YOU KNOW, 3 BOCCE BOCCE COURTS. YOU KNOW THAT THAT TO ME KIND OF GOES HAND IN HAND WITH ALL THIS INFORMATION, BECAUSE I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE THAT THAT YOU FOCUSED ON THE TOP 3.
THAT BEING, SAID, THE TOP 3 ALSO HAVE, I'LL SAY, AN ORGANIZED GROUP WITHIN THE COMMUNITY
THAT IS WRITTEN A LOT OF LETTERS AS FAR AS CRICKET. BUT ALSO WHEN WHEN YOU'RE DOING POLLING. YOU HIT A LOT OF THAT. YOU KNOW IMMEDIATELY THAT THAT THOSE GROUPS CAN GET OUT THEIR MEMBERS. AND AND I WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED FROM LIKE THE LITTLE LEAGUE THAT WE DIDN'T HEAR. LITTLE LEAGUE DIDN'T MAKE THAT, YOU KNOW, DIDN'T COME UP AS HIGH, BECAUSE LOTS OF PARENTS AND ALL THAT THAT ARE ACTIVE. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE NEED, THE REQUEST FOR EXPANSION
I WOULD BE INTERESTED TO SEE, BECAUSE I LOOK AT
AND WE HAVE SKATEBOARDING. WE HAVE SOME SKATEBOARDING WE HAVE, BUT LIKE DISC GOLF, THE BARRIER TO ADDING A PRACTICE DISC GOLF AREA IS JUST BASICALLY A POLE WITH A BASKET IN DIFFERENT PARKS. SO SO THE COST INVESTED
ISN'T AS NEEDED. YOU KNOW, IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT IF IT'S A FULL, LET'S SAY, FRISBEE GOLF AREA. BUT A PRACTICE LEVEL COULD BE IMPLEMENTED. AND AND SO I APPRECIATE YOU FOCUSING ON KIND OF THE TOP 3.
BUT THERE'S THE CONCEPT OF BUILD IT, AND THEY WILL COME.
WHAT?
WHAT I'M TRYING, WHAT WE'RE HOPING IS, YOU KNOW, NEED THE THE NEEDS FOR THE HIGHEST REQUESTS FROM A FROM A FROM A RESIDENT STANDPOINT. BUT ALSO, IF THERE IS A LACK LIKE, WE DON'T HAVE A SINGLE
FRISBEE GOLF LOCATION IN THE CITY
TRYING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF
ALL RESIDENTS TO SOME LEVEL. SO WE'RE TRYING TO BALANCE THOSE 2 THINGS.
AND I APPRECIATE, IT'S LIKE, OKAY, WE NEED MORE CRICKET. DEFINITELY. WE NEED. YOU KNOW, WE NEED MORE PICKLEBALL COURTS. THIS IS WHAT YOU KNOW. THE NATIONAL NEED FOR PICKLEBALL THAT WE HEAR, YOU KNOW, THAT MAKES NATIONAL NEWS.
BUT AND SO, MEETING THOSE NEEDS FROM THE HIGH REQUEST IS ALSO IS IMPORTANT. BUT THERE'S ALSO IT'S LIKE.
WHAT'S THE BARRIER FOR FOR LAWN BOWLING? FOR YOU KNOW A FEW OF THESE OTHERS THAT THAT OKAY, WE HAVE X NUMBER OF HORSESHOE PITCHES WITHIN WITHIN THE CITY.
THAT IT'S IT'S A BALANCE OF THOSE 2 THINGS, MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE IT'S LIKE, OKAY, WE HAVE, YOU KNOW, ONE HORSESHOE PITCH, BUT I KNOW WE HAVE MORE THAN THAT. BUT OKAY, IN ORDER TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE RESIDENTS.
CONCEIVABLY IT'S 3 MORE HORSESHOE PITCHES, AND THAT COST IS
$5,000 $10,000, YOU KNOW. IT'S LIKE IT'S IT'S, YOU KNOW, RIPPING UP A PORTION OF THE PARK AND INSTALLING. SO SO I'M HOPING THAT WHEN THIS COMES BACK TO COUNCIL WE GET KIND OF THAT MIX. APPRECIATE LOOKING AT THE 20 YEAR 20 YEAR BUDGET. YOU KNOW WE HAVE A 20 YEAR PLAN ALREADY TO RENOVATE EVERY PARK OVER THE NEXT 20 YEARS.
HOW THAT! HOW THIS FITS INTO THAT OVERALL PICTURE.
YOU KNOW, FROM A COST STANDPOINT. AND AND I THINK IT'S ALSO, FROM A PRIORITIZATION STANDPOINT, MAKING SURE, FROM AN EDUCATION OF OUR OF OUR COUNCIL AS WELL AS OUR RESIDENTS. HERE'S THE HERE'S THE ORDER THAT WE'RE PLANNING TO DO THOSE UPDATES FROM FROM A PARK, FROM AN EXISTING PARK PLAN, AND HOW THE ADDITIONAL NEEDS
OR OR, LET'S SAY, PROPOSED ADDITIONAL ADDITIONS TO THOSE PARKS THAT'S COMING OUT OF THIS PLAN WOULD BE FED INTO THOSE PARK UPDATES, OR OR WOULD STAFF ACTUALLY LOOK AT
IMPLEMENTING OUTSIDE OF THE CYCLE OF A PARK RENOVATION.
SO I'M THROWING OUT A LOT BECAUSE I KNOW MY MY TIME IS SHORT. IF YOU HAVE ANY RESPONSE, OR YOU KNOW, THAT'S THAT'S THE MAJORITY OF THE ISSUES THAT I WOULD LIKE TO GET OUT THERE.
ANY ANY RESPONSE, AT LEAST FROM FROM FUNDING. AND
WE'LL WE'LL FOCUS ON THAT FUNDING AS FAR AS HOW THIS ROLLS INTO THE PARK RENOVATIONS.
YEAH. I I CAN SPEAK TO THAT. BRIEFLY, AND I THINK CHIP TAYLOR CAN ALSO ADD
TO THAT WHEN IT COMES TO FUNDING FOR PARK RENOVATIONS. YOU KNOW
THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE ALREADY IN THE WORKS LIKE WE MENTIONED LOS PALMAS. I THINK THIS IS SOME GOOD INFORMATION TO INCLUDE IN THAT PROCESS, IN TERMS OF
FURTHER NEIGHBORHOOD OUTREACH TO FIND OUT WHAT ESPECIALLY THE NEIGHBORS IN THAT AREA. AND THEN THE SURROUNDING AREAS ARE LOOKING FOR. SPECIFICALLY, THIS WAS A VERY BROAD NET WHEN IT CAME TO A SURVEY. SO AS WE GO FORWARD BEFORE WE REALLY, YOU KNOW.
START ANY KIND OF CONSTRUCTION, WE WANT TO DO A LOT MORE OUTREACH IN THOSE AREAS TO MAKE SURE THAT'S REALLY WHAT THAT COMMUNITY NEEDS. WHEN IT COMES TO THE
THE FUNDING FOR IT. I'M GOING TO TURN THAT OVER TO CHIP.
CHIP TAYLOR: GOOD EVENING, MAYOR. COUNCIL MEMBERS, CHIP TAYLOR HOPEFULLY. YOU HEAR ME HERE? I'M SORRY I'M NOT IN THERE IN PERSON. I WAS A LITTLE BIT UNDER THE WEATHER TODAY, BUT AS FAR AS THE FUNDING FOR THIS, SO THIS IS REALLY THE 1ST STEP I THINK, YOU KNOW, WITH, I THINK LRS WAS KIND OF LEADING THIS TO. ARE THESE THE TYPE OF THINGS THAT THE COUNCIL WANTS TO SEE GOING FORWARD SO KIND OF GET PAST THAT STEP AND UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE THE PROJECTS THAT COUNCIL IS INTERESTED IN, AND THEN WE WOULD ESSENTIALLY LOOK THROUGH THE CIP BUDGET THIS YEAR.
CHIP TAYLOR: THAT'S 1 OF THE BENEFITS OF HAVING IT DONE NOW IN JANUARY. IS THAT THEN WE CAN TRY TO INCORPORATE THESE INTO THE CIP BUDGET FOR COUNCIL TO REVIEW. AND THEN, SO WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE EXACTLY HOW THESE ARE ALL GOING TO FIT INTO THE BUDGET JUST YET, BUT WE WANTED TO SEE WHICH ONES WE'RE GOING TO FIT 1ST BEFORE WE DO THAT.
OKAY, I APPRECIATE THAT. AND AND LASTLY,
WOULD AT, AS THIS COMES BACK TO US, GETTING A BETTER UPDATE ON WHERE A PROPOSED BAYLANDS, PART BAY BAYLANDS CRICKET PITCH WOULD WOULD COME IN. AND WE DON'T NEED THAT ANSWER NOW. BUT BUT DEFINITELY, UNLESS
CITY MANAGER WANTS TO SPEAK, YEAH, JUST FOR CLARIFICATION, YOU MEAN, LIKE A SEMI PRO PRACTICE FACILITY OR CRICKET PITCH ASSOCIATED WITH THE OTHER STUDY ISSUE ON CORRECT, WHETHER OR NOT SEMI PRO OR JUST A CRICKET PITCH, YOU KNOW, CONCEIVABLY CHANGES TO BAYLANDS PARK TO ENABLE PART OF PART OF THIS. YOU KNOW SOME SOME OF THESE NEEDS.
I DON'T, WAS WAS BAYLANDS PARK, ALSO EVALUATED FROM THE OVERALL OVERALL PROJECT. SO WE ONLY LOOKED AT OUR EXISTING PARKS AND NOT THE RENTED. OKAY, SO I WOULD. I WOULD. I WOULD ADD, BAYLANDS PARK.
CONCEIVABLE CHANGES
AS WE'RE LOOKING AT THE ASSESSMENT AND HOW WE MEET THOSE NEEDS WITHIN A CITY STANDPOINT. YEAH, UNDERSTOOD. AND WHERE WE ARE, WE ARE WORK. BAYLANDS IS OWNED BY THE COUNTY AND LEASED BY AND OPERATED BY THE CITY. WE ARE REACHING OUT TO THE COUNTY TO DISCUSS VARIOUS OPTIONS AROUND CRICKET AT BAYLANDS.
OKAY?
SO WE HAVE ABOUT 20 MIN LEFT AND 6 COUNCIL MEMBERS THAT MIGHT NEED TO WANT TO COMMENT. SO IN THE AUDIENCE, SO WE'LL HAVE COUNCIL MEMBER MELLINGER.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MADAM VICE MAYOR, AND THANK YOU, STAFF, FOR AN EXCELLENT PRESENTATION.
I'LL TRY TO BE AS QUICK AS I CAN. I SHARE THE MAYOR'S CONCERN ABOUT THE LASER FOCUS ON 3 SPORTS THAT WE'VE SEEN HERE. YOU KNOW, I'M PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE MEETING THE NEEDS FOR LITTLE LEAGUE AND SOCCER AND SO WHENEVER THE NEXT STUDY SESSION ON THIS ITEM COMES BACK, I WOULD LOVE TO SEE SOME ANALYSIS ON THOSE NEEDS AND POSSIBLY SOME OUTREACH TO THE LOCAL LITTLE LEAGUE AND SOCCER ORGANIZATIONS.
SO
SOMETHING THAT I'M CURIOUS ABOUT IS, LAST YEAR WE HAD A STUDY SESSION ON TENNIS CENTER UPGRADES AND SO HOW THE PROPOSED TENNIS ADDITIONS? I'M BLANKING ON THE EXACT DETAILS THAT WE DISCUSSED THEN.
BUT YOU KNOW HOW THE PROPOSED TENNIS AND PICKLEBALL ADDITIONS THAT WE'RE ADDING TO OTHER PARKS IN THIS PROPOSAL INTERACT WITH THE TENNIS CENTER UPGRADES IN THE CONTEXT OF THE TENNIS CENTER UPGRADES. THAT'S SOMETHING I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN A FUTURE STAFF REPORT ON THIS.
OH.
SO LET'S SEE, HERE I AM STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE IDEA OF THE IMPROVE IMPROVING THE CRICKET PITCH AT ORTEGA PARK, AND A CRICKET PITCH AT LAS PALMAS. THERE IS TREMENDOUS DEMAND FOR CRICKET IN THE COMMUNITY AND THAT COMMUNITY'S NEEDS HAVE NOT BEEN WELL MET BY THE CITY FOR MANY YEARS NOW, AND IMPROVING OUR CRICKET FACILITIES IS SOMETHING I'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT NEEDS FOR THAT FROM OUR COMMUNITY FOR MANY YEARS NOW.
AND SO I AM CERTAINLY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT.
SO I WANT. AND THIS IS SOMETHING. I IMAGINE MR. KESTING FROM PARKS AND REC. MIGHT BE GIVING COMMENT. I'D LOVE TO HEAR THE PARKS COMMISSION'S RATIONALE ON THEIR CONCERNS ON THE PICKLEBALL STRIPING FOR BASKETBALL COURTS. I WILL SAY THAT I HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT THAT COULD LEAD TO CONFLICT. BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT USERS OF THOSE FACILITIES. AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I'M A BIT HESITANT ABOUT.
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE. 2. YEAH, YOU HAVE 2 DIFFERENT SPORTS.
THERE IS. THERE IS THE CONCERN THAT COULD LEAD TO SOME DEGREE OF CONFLICT BETWEEN DIFFERENT USER GROUPS. AND THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING I'D LIKE TO AVOID. COULD WE GET SLIDE 41, WHICH IS THE ENSIGNAL PARK ASSESSMENT.
SO
MY CONCERN HERE IS, HOW CLOSE WOULD THE PROPOSED PICKLEBALL COURTS BE TO THE MULTIFAMILY HOUSING? I DON'T REMEMBER OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD WHERE THE MULTIFAMILY HOUSING IS RELATIVE TO ENSIGNAL PARK.
BUT THAT IS A CONCERN. DO. DOES STAFF HAVE AN ANSWER ON THAT?
I DON'T HAVE AN EXACT MEASUREMENT. BUT WE DID
USE A METRIC BASED ON PREVIOUS NOISE STUDIES
WITH A MINIMUM OF 150 FEET FROM THE PICKLEBALL COURT TO ADJACENT RESIDENCES TO LIMIT OUR
SELECTION OF OF LOCATIONS.
OH, SO IT'S LESS THAN 150 FEET
OR MORE THAN A HUNDRED 50 FEET. EXCUSE ME. OKAY.
IF WE WERE LOOKING AT ADDING PICKLEBALL COURTS AT ENSIGNEL PARK, I THINK THAT IT MIGHT BE BETTER TO CONCENTRATE THEM ALONG THE NORTHERN EDGE
IN THE NORTHWESTERN AT CORNER, MAYBE. AND THE REASON I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE THAT BACKS UP TO A AN OFFICE PARKING LOT IN AN OFFICE COMPLEX. AND SO THAT WOULD BE PRETTY WELL AWAY
FROM LOOKING AT GOOGLE MAPS, FROM THE RESIDENTIAL, WHICH IS ACROSS CORTE MADERA.
SO PUSHING THAT FURTHER NORTH WOULD HELP TO INSULATE THOSE RESIDENTS FROM THAT NOISE.
ARE YOU READY TO SORT OF WRAP IT UP? THANK YOU, MADAM VICE MAYOR. YES, I THINK THAT DOES IT FOR MY COMMENTS. SO, TO SUMMARIZE, I SHARE SOME OF THE PARKS COMMISSION'S CONCERNS ABOUT JOINT STRIPING, THE BASKETBALL COURTS AND FOR PICKLEBALL. I THINK THAT WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT MOVING THE PICKLEBALL ON IN ENSIL PARK FURTHER TO THE NORTHWEST, ADDITIONAL OUTREACH TO THE SOCCER AND LITTLE LEAGUE COMMUNITIES STRONGLY SUPPORT THE CRICKET. THANK YOU.
OKAY. NOW, COUNCIL MEMBER SHRINAVASAN, I'M SORRY, VICE MAYOR. I'M SORRY, COUNCIL MEMBER. IF I CAN JUST CLARIFY SOMETHING. THE ORIGINAL STUDY ISSUE WAS SPONSORED BY THE PARKS AND REC COMMISSION. IT SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR US TO FOCUS ON PICKLEBALL, TENNIS AND CRICKET.
SO THAT MAY BE SOME OF THE MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE SCOPE OF THE ENTIRE STUDY STAFF WAS NOT PLANNING TO BRING ANY ACTIONS BACK OUTSIDE OF THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGNS FOR EACH PARK.
WE WILL LOOK IN THE UPCOMING CAPITAL CYCLE IF THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO RESTRIPE EXISTING COURTS LIKE SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS. AND OF COURSE LAS PALMAS IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF US. SO YOU'D SEE THAT
IMPACT SHORTLY ON THE PROPOSED CRICKET FIELD AT LAS PALMAS. SO I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT IF COUNCIL WANTS FOR US TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT, WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE THAT DIRECTION AND AND GO AHEAD AND CHANGE CHANGE OUR APPROACH AT THIS POINT. BUT I'LL JUST WANT TO GIVE THAT CLARIFYING COMMENT TO COUNCIL.
I HADN'T REALIZED THAT THE ORIGINAL STUDY ISSUE WAS LIMITED TO THOSE 3. AS LONG AS THERE ARE SOME UPCOMING OPPORTUNITIES FOR DISCUSSIONS WITH LITTLE LEAGUE AND SOCCER, MAYBE OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THE STUDY ISSUE.
YEAH. AND I DON'T WANT TO SAY IT WAS LIMITED BECAUSE WE DID SURVEY ALL OF IT. BUT IT DID SAY, ESPECIALLY PICKLEBALL, TENNIS AND CRICKET. SO WE DID MAKE SURE WE HAD SOME FEEDBACK FROM THOSE GROUPS IN THE IN THE SURVEY. UNDERSTOOD? THANK YOU.
OKAY, COUNCILMEMBER SHRINIVASAN, AND WE HAVE ABOUT 15 MIN. THANK YOU, MAYOR. THANK YOU. VICE MAYOR.
YEAH.
I ALSO CONCUR WITH THE MAYOR. I HAD WRITTEN DOWN. I WANT TO SEE THE DATA USAGE OF THE PARKS. HOW MANY? WHAT ARE THE SPORTS WHICH ARE USING OUR EXISTING PARK, EITHER THROUGH RESERVATION OR EVEN POINT OF TIME SURVEYS.
AND THEN THAT IS VERY, VERY IMPORTANT. IT'S SURVEY. WHAT YOU HAVE DONE IS INTERESTING, BUT THAT IS
FUTURE REQUIREMENT. BUT HOW ARE WE USING THE, FOR EXAMPLE, A SOCCER FIELD? OR WHAT ARE THE OTHER SPORTS ARE USING THAT? AND THEN WHAT IS THE CONTENTION? AND THEN WE NEED TO KNOW THE EXACT USAGE OF THAT. SO THAT IS VERY, VERY IMPORTANT.
I ALSO SUGGEST, I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST.
IN ADDITION TO TALKING TO THE RESIDENTS AND DOING THE ONLINE SURVEY TALKING TO SPORTING ASSOCIATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE RECEIVED A EMAIL TODAY FROM SOCCER ASSOCIATION.
SOMEBODY LIKE THAT THAT SHOULD BE CONSULTED WHETHER IT'S FOR YOUTH, SOCCER OR ADULT SOCCER. WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THAT
AS A PART OF THE FINAL STUDY, AS MAYOR POINTED OUT, BAYLAND SPARK. AND THEN I WOULD LIKE TO IT TO INCLUDE BATTING CAGES. ALSO, I KNOW, DURING THE PARK AND RECREATION COMMISSION THERE WAS A
A MENTION OF THAT, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT
THE OTHER ISSUE I SEE WITH THIS REPORT IS, FOR EXAMPLE, SLIDE NUMBER 39,
FAIR OAKS PARK DOESN'T INCLUDE CRICKET, BUT THEN, ON THE OTHER SLIDES WE INCLUDE CRICKET, AS, FOR EXAMPLE, WHERE CRICKET IS PLACED, PLAYED, ONE IN AUTICA PARK AND FAIR OAKS PARK, AS I KNOW OF AS A CRICKET PLAYER. I KNOW FAIR OAKS DOESN'T HAVE A PITCH, SO WE NEED TO CORRECT THAT.
AND THEN ALSO, LIGHTING IS INCLUDED AS A PART OF CRICKET SPORT WHICH
TODAY IT IS NOT, FOR EXAMPLE, IN AUTICA PARK. ONLY THE LIGHTING COVERS JUST THE SOFTWARE SOFTBALL PITCHING, SOFTBALL GAME AREA, NOT THE CRICKET AREA, SO INCLUDING THAT COST LIGHTING COST WILL ARTIFICIALLY INFLATE THE COST OF IMPLEMENTATION.
SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE INCLUDE CORRECTLY.
MORE IMPORTANTLY, I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW.
YEAH, YOU ARE PROPOSING ALL THIS PICKLEBALL, NEW CODES AND RESTRIPING, AND ALL THOSE THINGS.
IS THERE A DEMAND FOR THAT? THAT'S WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW? IT'S NOT LIKE WE HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES. WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT. WE HAVE, AS MAYOR POINTED OUT, WE HAVE ALL THESE SPORTS WE NEED TO CATER TO. SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE DATA ON WHAT WOULD BE THE EXACT USAGE. AND THEN THE YOU ALSO MENTIONED THAT ONLINE. WE GOT ABOUT 2,000 RESPONSES.
DO YOU? DO YOU HAVE ANY WAY OF KNOWING HOW MANY OF THEM WERE FROM SUNNYVALE OR OUTSIDE SUNNYVALE, OR
ANY IDEA ON THAT? IF NOT, I WOULD SUGGEST, INCLUDING THAT AS A PART OF THE FUTURE SURVEY. ONE SECOND, LET ME COMPLAIN.
YES, WE DO HAVE DATA. WE ASKED FOR THE ZIP CODE OF THE SURVEY RESPONDER. OKAY, THE MAJORITY OF THEM WERE FROM SUNNYVALE. BUT WE DID GET SOME THAT WERE OUTSIDE. OKAY.
SO THOSE ARE MAIN QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
AND IF WE COULD JUST RESPOND TO A COUPLE OF THINGS FROM COUNCILMEMBER, SRINIVASAN.
TRACY. HI, SO TRACY GOT RECREATION SERVICES MANAGER. SO I JUST WANTED TO GO BACK TO THE OUTREACH THAT WE DID, AND WE DID REACH OUT TO ALL OF OUR GROUPS THAT USE THE FIELD. SO THAT INCLUDED THE LITTLE LEAGUE GROUPS, THE SOCCER GROUPS, SO PRETTY MUCH ANYBODY THAT USES OUR FIELDS ALL GOT MULTIPLE EMAILS INVITING THEM TO TAKE PART OF THE SURVEY. AND WE DID BREAK DOWN. WE HAVE LOTS OF DATA. SO WE CAN DEFINITELY BRING THAT BACK AT A CERTAIN TIME. IF THERE'S SPECIFIC THINGS YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.
THANK YOU.
OKAY, SO WE'RE DOING PRETTY GOOD ON TIME. BUT WE ARE GOING TO GO OVER. AND IT'S OKAY. IF WE GO OVER. SO COUNCIL MEMBERS ASK THE QUESTION THAT YOU WANT TO ASK AND MAKE YOUR COMMENTS. SO NEXT WE'LL HAVE COUNCIL MEMBER LAKE.
HI, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION. I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE JUST ANSWERED MY QUESTION, TRACY, BUT I HAVE A FEW OTHERS JUST ABOUT THE PROCESS WISE HOW THE SURVEY WAS SENT OUT. AND I THINK YOU SAID IT WAS SENT THROUGH EMAIL.
SO WE DID A WHOLE LIST OF SO EMAIL IT WAS ON THE HORIZON. IT WAS ON OUR WEBSITE. IT WAS SENT TO ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE REGISTERED FOR OUR CLASSES. SO WE HAD MULTIPLE WAYS THAT WE DID OUTREACH FOR THE SURVEY. OKAY, THANK YOU. I GUESS WHAT I REALLY AM WONDERING IS TO WHAT EXTENT THAT IS ESSENTIALLY
HACKABLE TO SOME EXTENT, IN ORDER WHERE PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO FORWARD IT WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES, AND LIKE ARTIFICIALLY INFLATE NUMBERS. AND IF WE HAVE TO ANY DEGREE WHAT SORT OF IDEA THAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED.
I WOULD SAY IT'S DEFINITELY POSSIBLE THAT IT COULD BE HACKABLE. PEOPLE COULD TAKE IT MULTIPLE TIMES. IT WAS NOT A SUPER SOPHISTICATED SURVEY. WE WERE ON A BUDGET. SO WE KIND OF USED OUR RESOURCES. SO THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF SOME INFLATION. BUT
TO THE POINT OF, I THINK
WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE COMMUNITY, RIGHT IS, PICKLEBALL REALLY WAS A NEED FOR THAT. BUT WE KNOW THERE'S LOTS OF OTHER SPORTS THAT HAVE VARYING NEEDS. SO
MORE ASSESSMENT COULD BE DONE.
THANK YOU. WE, THE COUNCIL, HAVE RECEIVED A LOT OF ADVOCACY FROM CRICKET ENTHUSIASTS OVER EMAIL THIS PAST WEEKEND, AND THEY WERE VERY INTERESTED IN THE CRICKET PITCH AT LAS PALMAS PARK. I THINK I UNDERSTAND FROM THE PRESENTATION THAT THAT'S BECAUSE
THERE, BECAUSE THERE IS ALREADY A CRICKET PITCH THERE. NO, THERE'S NOT, BECAUSE THAT'S IT'S A IT'S ACT SORRY.
ORTEGA HAS EVERYTHING. I'M I'M WONDERING IF YOU HAVE ANY INSIGHTS ABOUT WHY THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN REQUESTING SPECIFICALLY LAS PALMAS.
I WOULD SAY THAT BECAUSE LAS PALMAS IS COMING UP AS ONE OF THE PARKS TO BE REDONE IN THE COMING CYCLE. THAT THAT COULD BE. WHY, THERE'S MORE INTEREST.
IT OCCURRED TO ME READING SOME OF THESE EMAILS THAT SOME OF THE PEOPLE SENDING US. THESE EMAILS ARE COMING FROM PLACES LIKE FREMONT, AND TO SOME EXTENT I WOULD
SAY THAT MAYBE IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO HAVE A CRICKET PITCH ON THE NORTH SIDE OF TOWN, OFF 2, 37, WHERE IT WOULD BE ACCESSIBLE TO MORE RESIDENTS OF BAY AREA. BUT THAT'S
I KNOW THAT LAKEWOOD PARK IS ALSO COMING UP UNDER CONSIDERATION. SO IF THAT'S
A FACTOR, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT EXPLORED AS WELL.
I'M SORRY, COUNCIL MEMBER, BUT I BELIEVE LAKEWOOD PARK IS GONNA INCORPORATE SOME FORM OF A CRICKET FACILITY.
AND ALSO THAT'S WHY WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD ON ANY ONE OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE DO FURTHER OUTREACH IN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH I THINK WILL KIND OF HOPEFULLY SATISFY THAT IDEA THAT THERE'S OUTSIDE INFLUENCES THERE, AND REALLY TRY AND HONE IN ON. WHO'S IN THOSE THOSE PARTICULAR AREAS?
GREAT? THANK YOU SO MUCH. OKAY, THANK YOU. SO, COUNCIL MEMBER CISNEROS.
YEAH, THANK YOU. I JUST HAVE A FEW
BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO TRIM IT DOWN. FROM WHAT HAS BEEN SAID SO FAR DID THE SURVEY INCLUDE A QUALITATIVE OR ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. ASPECT TO IT.
YES, IT DID. OH, GREAT I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT ACTUALLY, BECAUSE TO UNDERSTAND THE RESIDENTS REASONING, THAT'S REALLY HELPFUL, BECAUSE WE SEE THESE NUMBERS, AND I'M THINKING THEY WANT PICKLEBALL LIKE, THERE'S A LOT OF DESIRE FOR PICKLEBALL ON BASKETBALL COURTS. BUT THERE AREN'T THAT MANY. AND SO
THERE ARE JUST THESE QUESTIONS RIGHT? I THINK THAT COUNCIL HAS
WOULD BE ANSWERED BY GETTING A NARRATIVE SUMMARY OF OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT, SO THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. AND THEN
I KNOW THAT THIS IS REALLY EARLY FOR THESE LOCATIONS. BUT THINKING BIG PICTURE ABOUT WHAT THESE AMENITIES WOULD OFFER TO THE COMMUNITY.
WOULD THIS BE ON A RESERVATION BASIS? WOULD CLASSES BE THROUGH THE CITY, THROUGH OUR PARKS AND REC DEPARTMENT, OR WOULD BE BE ALLOWED PRIVATE INSTRUCTORS TO DO THE CLASSES. AND THESE ARE JUST QUESTIONS THAT ARE COMING UP FOR ME, BECAUSE THAT ADDS TO THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT PIECE THAT WE HAVE, BECAUSE THAT REALLY DICTATES HOW THE COMMUNITY UTILIZES A SPACE, SO DO WE HAVE A SENSE OF THAT JUST OFF THE TOP OF OUR HEADS. A BALLPARK, OR HOW COULD WE CAPTURE THAT?
SO I THINK IT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT FACILITY AND WHAT AMENITY WE'RE LOOKING AT. BECAUSE FOR PICKLEBALL YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. REALLY, I THINK OUR AIM WAS TO PROVIDE A FREE SERVICE LIKE TENNIS, AND WHERE PEOPLE CAN JUST GO PLAY. BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT CRICKET IT WOULD BE A SHARED USE WITH A SHARED FIELD. SO IT REALLY DOES DEPEND ON WHAT WE'RE GOING TO PUT WHERE
TO GET THAT SENSE RIGHT? THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. AND THIS IS JUST COMING FROM THE LOS PALMAS EXPERIENCE, THINKING ABOUT PRIVATE INSTRUCTORS TAKING UP COURT SPACE. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAD THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION WITH THE COMMUNITY AROUND THIS. SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT JUST IN MY MIND, THAT STUCK OUT TO ME TO LOOK AT FOR FUTURE SITES, THAT WE MAY PUT THESE THINGS, AND JUST TO ANTICIPATE THAT CONVERSATION AND BEING ABLE TO ADDRESS IT.
AND I I JUST WANT TO ADD MY VOICE REALLY QUICKLY. I DON'T HAVE TO TALK WHOLE TON OF IT TON ABOUT IT. BUT
REGARDING A NEEDS, ASSESSMENT AND CURRENT AVAILABILITY OF FACILITIES TO HELP US UNDERSTAND, ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS SITE SELECTION. LOOKING AT THE DESIGN, BECAUSE
THAT'S A KEY PART GETTING A MORE HOLISTIC LOOK OF WHAT'S GOING TO FIT WITHIN THAT COMMUNITY WHAT'S GOING TO BEST SERVE.
AND OF COURSE, LIKE I THOUGHT OF SELECTION BIAS IMMEDIATELY. THERE'S A LOT OF WAYS THAT CAN HAPPEN IN A SURVEY. IT'S KIND OF UNAVOIDABLE AT SOME TIMES, BUT I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE QUALITATIVE ANSWERS ARE GOING TO HELP US UNDERSTAND AND KIND OF PULL OUT THOSE GEMS AND DECIDE ON THE VALIDITY OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AT ANY POINT.
SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT DATA BETTER ANYWAY. THANK YOU, COLLEAGUES, FOR HAVING SUCH GREAT QUESTIONS, AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM THE COMMUNITY.
THANK YOU. AND COUNCILMEMBER CHANG.
GREAT! THANK YOU. I'LL BE BRIEF, AND I WANT TO ECHO THE SENTIMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES. WHEN THIS COMES BACK. I'D LIKE TO SEE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF
INSTEAD OF THE, YOU KNOW, TOP SPORTS TO ADD OR EXPAND MORE ABOUT THE CURRENT CONDITIONS AND HOW TO IMPROVE. YOU KNOW WHAT AMENITIES ARE NEEDED TO IMPROVE THE CURRENT CONDITIONS. I FEEL THE SURVEY COULD ALSO BE.
YOU KNOW, THE DATA COULD BE SWAYED IN A WAY THAT PEOPLE WHO MIGHT NOT PLAY A SPORT BECAUSE THERE'S NOT LIGHTING IN THE EVENING, SO THEY MIGHT NOT FEEL AS COMPELLED TO PLAY. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE OF WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY LACKING THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH AND HOW TO IMPROVE ON THAT.
THANK YOU.
OKAY, ARE YOU? ARE YOU DONE?
OKAY, GREAT. AND I JUST HAVE BRIEF COMMENTS.
I NOTICED THAT SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE MORE TOWARDS SOUTH SUNNYVALE WHICH I'M IN, BUT I'M ALSO SENSITIVE TO THESE ARE RESOURCES WE HAVE, SO LOOKING AT, DIVIDING IT MORE EVENLY, IF POSSIBLE, MAKES SENSE TO CENTRAL AND NORTHERN SUNNYVALE.
AND ALSO WITH THE PICKLEBALL COURTS. I KNOW THEY'RE NOISY, AND SOME WAYS OF ATTENUATING THE NOISE ARE PAYING TREES, AND SO THE TREES WOULD ALSO SUCK UP GREENHOUSE GASES, SO THOSE WOULD BE. I KNOW THE PARKS AND PICKLE RENOVATION IS A LONG TIME AWAY, BUT MAYBE YOU COULD BE THINKING ABOUT TREES IN THOSE LOCATIONS. SO EXCELLENT
DETAILED REPORTS GREAT QUESTIONS FROM MY COLLEAGUES. SO NOW WE'LL GO TO OPEN PUBLIC COMMENT
ON THIS SPECIFIC ITEM. SO PLEASE SUBMIT YOUR SPEAKER CARD TO THE CLERK, OR RAISE YOUR HAND ON THE ZOOM OR DIAL 9. I'LL CALL ON MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC PARTICIPATING IN PERSON, 1ST FOLLOWED BY REMOTE SPEAKERS, AND THE SPEAKERS WILL HAVE 1 MIN TO SPEAK.
SO
OH, OKAY, OKAY, CARDS. IT'S MY 1ST STUDY SESSION. OKAY? SO WHY DON'T WE HAVE EMILY DANA
AND THEN LINE UP PERUCO MATSUDA.
HELLO! MY NAME IS EMILY DANNER. I'M A SINGAPORE RESIDENT SINCE 2,010. I PLAY PICKLEBALL EVERY DAY WITH MY HUSBAND AND MY SON
AND I LIVE 5 MIN FROM LESS THAN MYS BACK. BUT I DON'T PLAY IN SUNNYVALE BECAUSE THERE ARE NO FREE PICKLEBALL COURTS IN SUNNYVALE, SO I PLAY ALL AROUND THE SOUTH BAY IN LOS SANTOS, CUPERTINO PALO ALTO. I'M EVEN PART OF A COMMERCIAL CLUB IN SAN JOSE, BUT I CANNOT PLAY FOR FREE IN SUNNYVALE. SO I'M EXTREMELY SUPPORTIVE OF THE PROPOSED DESIGN TO
BUILD NEW FACILITIES IN DE ANZA AND ENCINO, AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THESE DESIGNS HAVE 6 TO 12 COURTS, BECAUSE THEY WILL ALLOW COMMUNITY BUILDING AND BEEN THE CRITICAL MASS FOR DROPPING GAMES FOR PICKLEBALL.
I WANT TO SPEAK TO THE QUESTIONS RAISED BY THE MAYOR AND THE COUNCIL MEMBERS ABOUT USAGE VERSUS DEMAND YOU SAW IN THE SURVEY. THERE ARE LOTS OF DEMAND FOR PICKLEBALL WITH. IS THE USAGE ACTUALLY THERE, IF I COULD CONTINUE A LITTLE BIT.
I
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YEAH. WE NEED TO MOVE ON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. AND I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE DATA ABOUT USAGE BY MAIL COUNCIL. YEAH, THANK YOU. SO NOW WE HAVE ORACLE M
HI, MY NAME IS HARUKO MATSUDA, AND I'M THE VICE PRESIDENT AT SUNNYVALE SOCCER CLUB. I GENERALLY SUPPORT ADDITIONAL OUTDOOR RECREATIONAL FACILITIES FOR THE COMMUNITY, BUT I'D LIKE TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION THE ISSUE OF OUR ATHLETIC FIELDS BEING CONTINUOUSLY ENCROACHED BY NEW FACILITIES, LIKE SCHOOL BUILDINGS AND OTHER USAGES OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS. SO THE FIELD SPACE HAS CONTINUOUSLY SHRUNK.
SO WHAT YOU MAY CONSIDER A SMALL CARVE OUT FOR THE TENNIS COURT MAY ACTUALLY JUST LIMIT THE THE SIZE OF THE FIELD THAT WE CAN HAVE FOR SOCCER, FOR INSTANCE, FOR, LIKE MIDDLE SCHOOL OR FIELD THAT THAT USED TO BE THERE, YOU CAN NOW ONLY PUT IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SIZE FIELD.
SO PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO THE IMPACT ON THE EXISTING FIELDS AND LONG TERM, THOUGH IT'D BE GREAT IF YOU GUYS COULD CONSIDER MAYBE CONVERTING THE SUNKEN GARDEN GOLF COURSE INTO A NICE, SHINY, ATHLETIC FIELD.
SO PLEASE PUT THAT ON THE TABLE AS CONSIDERED IN CONSIDERATION AS WELL. THANK YOU.
OKAY. SO NOW I HAVE D.
K.
GOOD AFTERNOON COUNCIL. MY NAME IS DAVID KESSING. I'M THE CHAIRMAN OF THE PARKS AND RECREATION COMMISSION, AND I AM SPEAKING IN THAT CAPACITY NOW.
I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE STUDY. I HAVE TO AGREE BY HAVING LIGHTS IN OUR PARKS IN THE EVENING, SPECIFICALLY AT LAS PALMAS PARKS AND AT OUR OTHER PARKS. IT'S AN EXCELLENT IDEA. IT'S A WAY TO GET OUR COMMUNITY OUT TO USE OUR PARKS. MORE OFTEN WE CAN SEE THROUGH THE USE OF LIGHTING AT FAIR OAKS PARK AN INCREASE FIELD USAGE BY OVER 600% SINCE PRE-COVID NUMBERS. I'VE SENT THIS DATA TO YOU. I'M SURE YOU CAN ALSO SEE IT FROM THE PARKS DEPARTMENT FROM MRS. TORRES.
I HAVE TO SAY, DO NOT STRIPE BASKETBALL COURTS WITH PICKLEBALL COURTS. THIS IS NOT A GOOD IDEA. THE CULTURES ARE NOT GOING TO MIX. THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK OUT. WELL, THE PICKLEBALL PEOPLE DON'T GET ALONG WITH TENNIS PLAY PEOPLE. THAT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SPORT. YOU'RE GOING TO MIX IT OVER OVER TO ANOTHER SYSTEM THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.
WHAT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT IS FINDING OTHER SPACE WITH THE CITY THAT THE CITY HAS AVAILABLE, AND DPW. 2,506 HAS A WAY OF FINDING SPACE THAT WE ALREADY OWN, SUCH AS THE PARKING LOTS FOR CALTRAIN, AND TURNING THOSE THINGS INTO PICKLEBALL COURTS OR TENNIS COURTS WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT IDEA. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. GAIL G.
AND THEN, AFTER GAIL WILL BE PRAKASH G
HI! MY NAME IS GAIL. I HAVE BEEN A RESIDENT OF SUNNYVALE FOR 20 YEARS NOW. I JUST WANTED TO RAISE THE ISSUE THAT THE PICK, THE
THE CRICKET PITCH IS ACTUALLY A HARD SURFACE. SO WHEN YOU INTRODUCE THAT INTO THE MIDDLE OF A FIELD THAT IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH OTHER SPORTS THAT COULD BE PLAYED ACROSS THAT FIELD, FOR EXAMPLE, ORTEGA, WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PUT 11 V. 11 FIELD, WHICH IS, YOU KNOW, 100 YARDS BY 60 YARDS. BUT WE CAN'T DO THAT. WE HAVE TO PUT SMALLER FIELDS IN THERE, BECAUSE THAT CRICKET PITCH IS JUST
IT'S JUST KIND OF IN THE WAY, ANYWAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I JUST NOT SURE. YOU ALL KNOW THAT IT IS A HARD SURFACE.
OKAY, THANK YOU. AND RAKASH. G.
GOOD EVENING, COUNCIL MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY HERE, THANKS FOR A WORD, AND STAFF CONDUCTING A DETAILED SURVEY ON THIS AND
SPEAKING HERE FOR MYSELF, I MEAN, NOT AS A
YOUTH SPORTS VOLUNTEER, BUT NOT AS A EVEN THOUGH I'M A MEMBER OF THE
THE PARKS AND DIRECTORS COMMISSION. I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY A COUPLE OF THINGS. ONE I WROTE A LONG EMAIL. I WASN'T SURE IF I'LL MAKE IT IN PERSON TO THIS MEETING TODAY. BUT SO I WROTE A LONG EMAIL TO. SO ONE OF THE THINGS I WANTED TO CLARIFY. THERE IS NO PITCH PLANNED AT.
OR
LAKEWOOD PARK, I MEAN, THAT'S IT IS OFF OF THAT. SIMILARLY, I MEAN JUST TO CLARIFY. YOU DON'T NEED FOR CRICKET PITCH TYPICALLY NOT PLAYED ON A HARD PITCH.
AND, UNLIKE WHAT'S IT? WE HAVE AN ORTEGA PARK THAT'S A MAKESHIFT.
IT'S REALLY PLAYED ON A CLAY SURFACE. AND I DID CLARIFY THAT IN ONE OF MY EMAILS AS WELL TO THE CITY COUNCIL AND HOPE THAT'S WHAT WILL BE INCORPORATED. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
AND SO DO WE HAVE ANYONE ELSE THAT WANTS TO SPEAK ON THIS ITEM BEFORE WE GO TO REMOTE SPEAKERS.
UP HAVE, I WILL GO TO REMOTE SPEAKERS.
SO I'M READY. 1ST UP IS COURTNEY J. FOLLOWED BY BLANCA GUERRERO
COURTNEY. YOU'VE BEEN UNMUTED, AND YOU HAVE 1 MIN TO ADDRESS THE CITY COUNCIL.
CORTNEY JANSEN: GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE, COURTNEY JANSEN, SPEAKING TONIGHT ON MY OWN BEHALF. THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION, AND THANK YOU FOR THE CALL OUT FOR NATURAL GRASS IN THE EARLY SLIDES. IT DID NOT GO UNNOTICED.
CORTNEY JANSEN: I DID KIND OF WANT TO ECHO WHAT VICE MAYOR, CELL, AND COUNCIL MEMBER LAY SAID ABOUT THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE FIELDS. IF I LOOK AT THIS SLIDE 50,
CORTNEY JANSEN: IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE BASICALLY EVERY SINGLE NEW DEVELOPMENT IS HAPPENING UNDER OR SOUTH OF THE CALTRAIN TRACKS AND NOT NORTH OF THAT. AND IF WE WANT TO GROW THESE SPORTS, THEN KIDS IN LAKEWOOD, SAN MIGUEL, BISHOP, AND SO FORTH, NEED TO HAVE ACCESS.
CORTNEY JANSEN: SO, AS PART OF THE NEXT PHASE OF COMMUNITY OUTREACH, I WOULD ASK THAT YOU REACH OUT TO NEIGHBORHOODS, NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATIONS IN NORTH SUNNYVALE, REACH OUT TO THE SCHOOLS OR THE PTAS. IT'S UNCLEAR. FROM WHAT MY THOUGHT TONIGHT, IF THE DEMAND FOR STUFF IN SOUTH SUNNYVALE IS BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY WHERE PEOPLE ARE PLAYING IT, OR BECAUSE THAT JUST HAPPENS TO BE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO PROVIDED ALL OF THE OUTREACH. SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME, AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING WHERE THIS GOES. GOOD NIGHT.
NEXT UP IS BLANCA G. FOLLOWED BY GANESH P. BLANCA. YOU'VE BEEN UNMUTED, AND YOU HAVE 1 MIN TO ADDRESS THE CITY COUNCIL.
BLANCA GUERRERO: HELLO! MY NAME IS, I APPRECIATE THE TIME TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT THE PEOPLE BOARD.
BLANCA GUERRERO: YEAH. I HAVE BEEN A RESIDENT OF SUNNY VALLEY FOR MORE THAN 40 YEARS SIGNING OFF.
BLANCA GUERRERO: SO I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE NEED FOR PICKLE BALL COURTS TO BE FREE FOR US IN SOME WAY IS
BLANCA GUERRERO: REALLY REALLY BIG. I PLAY ALL THE TIME AT CUPERTINO, WHERE WE HAVE ALMOST A THOUSAND MEMBERS, AND I FEEL LIKE I'M A STRANGER IN THERE BECAUSE I DON'T BELONG. I DON'T PAY TAXES IN CUPERTINO, HOWEVER, THEY HAVE BEEN EMBRACING ME IN PROVIDING ME A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE MY LIFE WITH A GREAT COMMUNITY THAT WE CAN CREATE IN SUNNYVALE. SO I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT SUNNYVALE DOESN'T PROVIDE THAT TYPE OF A
BLANCA GUERRERO: SERVICES FOR US.
BLANCA GUERRERO: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.
NEXT UP IS GANESH P. FOLLOWED BY RAJESH R. GANESH. YOU'VE BEEN UNMUTED, AND YOU HAVE 1 MIN TO ADDRESS THE CITY COUNCIL.
I CAN ASK. YOU SHOULD SEE A POP UP ON YOUR SCREEN ASKING YOU TO UNMUTE.
GANESH PRASAD: YES, YEAH. HIGH RESPECTED THE COUNCIL MEMBERS AND LEADERS.
GANESH PRASAD: THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.
GANESH PRASAD: I HAVE COME AND SPOKE MY MIND COUPLE OF TIMES IN THE PAST OPPORTUNITIES, AND I HAVE TO PROUDLY SAY THAT MY BOTH MY KIDS GOT THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRACTICE AND PLAY WITH SEVERAL YOUTH IN THIS AREA.
GANESH PRASAD: AND MY DAUGHTER JUST REPRESENTED UNITED STATES CRICKET TEAM. WORLD CUP TOOK THE TEAM TO SUPER 6 AND SHOULD BE RETURNING FROM MALAYSIA.
GANESH PRASAD: WE MADE A GREAT IMPACT BECAUSE OF THE LEADERS LIKE YOU, WHO GAVE THE OPPORTUNITY
GANESH PRASAD: FOR THE YOUTH TO PRACTICE AND REPRESENT PROUDLY
GANESH PRASAD: AROUND THE CORNER OF OLYMPICS IS INTRODUCING CRICKET.
GANESH PRASAD: AND MY SON IS ALSO EQUALLY PLAYING WITH THE EQUALLY TALENTED YOUTH IN THIS COMMUNITY.
GANESH PRASAD: THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THIS AGE, WITH ALL THE MOBILE AND DEVICES WHEN THE YOUTH IS AUTOMATICALLY GLUED TO THE COUCH.
GANESH PRASAD: I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS LEADERSHIP TO GIVE THE GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO THE YOUTH BY PROVIDING CRICKET PITCHES AND THE FACILITIES THEY REQUIRE, SO THAT THEY CAN PROUDLY REPRESENT OUR COMMUNITY IN THE UPCOMING OLYMPICS AND RELATED WORLD LEVEL GLOBAL PERFORMANCES.
OKAY, SO WE'LL ACCEPT NO MORE RAISED HANDS. SO JUST THE ONES THAT ARE RAISED REMOTELY WILL BE LEFT.
NEXT UP IS RAJESH R, FOLLOWED BY KAUSHIK V
RAJESH, YOU'VE BEEN UNMUTED, AND YOU HAVE 1 MIN TO ADDRESS THE CITY COUNCIL.
RAJESH RAVIKUMAR: HELLO! CAN YOU HEAR ME?
RAJESH RAVIKUMAR: YES, OKAY, THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR GIVING. YES, THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN REGARDS TO THIS STUDY HERE. THE 1 POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS AROUND THE LIGHTING OR THE NECESSITY OF LIGHTNING. MAJORITY OF THE MATCHES THAT WE PLAY TODAY IS USUALLY IN THE DAYTIME SOMEWHERE AROUND, YOU KNOW, STARTING FROM 9 O'CLOCK ALL THE WAY TO 4 O'CLOCK. SO EVEN THOUGH THE LIGHTS IS A NICE ADDITION, IT REALLY.
RAJESH RAVIKUMAR: YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT A NEED. AND YOU KNOW, WITHOUT THE LIGHTS I SAW THAT COST WAS A COUPLE 1 MILLION DOLLARS, SO THAT CAN EASILY BE REMOVED FROM THE CRICKET OR THE PROCESSOR TO THE UPDATES FOR THE CRICKET. AND ALSO ANOTHER POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS AGAIN, YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT TALENT IN THE YOUTH LEVEL. THERE IS A
RAJESH RAVIKUMAR: FRANCHISE TEAM THAT IS BASED OUT OF SAN FRANCISCO HERE, AND A LOT OF
RAJESH RAVIKUMAR: TALENT IS BEING FED TO THAT TEAM. AND SO THESE TYPE OF GROUNDS WILL DEFINITELY EXPAND THOSE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR YOUTH COMMUNITY TO BE ABLE TO PLAY CRICKET AT A PROFESSIONAL LEVEL AS THEY GROW INTO ADULTS. THANK YOU.
NEXT UP IS KAUSHIK V, FOLLOWED BY PRASHANT
KASHIK. YOU'VE BEEN UNMUTED, AND YOU HAVE 1 MIN TO ADDRESS THE CITY COUNCIL.
KAUSHIK VEMAREDDY: GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE. THANKS FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY.
KAUSHIK VEMAREDDY: I ECHO WITH THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER LIGHTING FOR THE CRICKET GROUND. SOME OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRICKET GROUNDS DOESN'T EVEN HAVE LIGHTING. LOOKS LIKE 2.5 TO 3 MILLION IS ONLY FOR LIGHTING, WHICH CAN BE EASILY AVOIDED IF REQUIRED. AND THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW IS, MOST OF US ARE ACTUALLY TRAVELING TO EVEN TRACY FREMONT, UNION CITY, AND MOST OF THESE FACILITIES DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A CLAY PITCH. SO ACTUAL GROUNDS WHERE WE PLAY ARE NOT APPROPRIATE, ACTUALLY NOT
KAUSHIK VEMAREDDY: APP GROUNDS FOR CRICKET. THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE PORTABLE PARTIES IN SOME CASES, SO
KAUSHIK VEMAREDDY: IT IS NOT THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF PLACES TO PLAY CRICKET, AND THE FACILITIES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE, SO I WOULD I WOULD REQUEST THE LEADERSHIP TO CONSIDER
KAUSHIK VEMAREDDY: HAVING THIS NEW FACILITIES IN SUNNYVALE, SO THAT WE CAN AT LEAST HAVE ONE OR 2 PROPER FACILITIES IN THE BAY AREA. THANK YOU.
NEXT UP IS PRASHANT, FOLLOWED BY NALLON K.
PRASHANT. YOU'VE BEEN UNMUTED, AND YOU HAVE 1 MIN TO ADDRESS THE CITY COUNCIL.
PRASHANTH: HI! EVERYONE THANKS AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. AND GOOD EVENING. SO I DO ECHO WITH QUITE A FEW FOLKS WHO MENTIONED ABOUT CRICKET AS BEING AN UPCOMING SPORT IN THE US. AND, AS YOU SEE IN US, WE DID MAKE IT TO OUR PLAYOFFS THIS YEAR. THERE IS A LOT OF INTEREST, ESPECIALLY IN THE BAY AREA HERE, LOCALLY, WHERE WE HAD TO TRAVEL FOR MANY OTHER PLACES LIKE TRACY. INSTEAD, IF WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES IN SUNNYVALE THAT GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO PRACTICE DURING WEEKDAYS AND GROOM MORE YOUTH TALENT, ESPECIALLY WITH
PRASHANTH: KIDS UNDER 10. THEY ARE ABLE TO PLAY OUTDOOR SPORTS, AND THAT'S A GREAT ASSET TO HAVE AND BUILD A TEAM FOR THE FUTURE. SO, LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING MORE POSITIVE RESPONSE FROM YOU FOLKS.
PRASHANTH: THANK YOU.
NEXT UP IS NOW IN K, FOLLOWED BY
THAGI. ALAN. YOU'VE BEEN UNMUTED, AND YOU HAVE 1 MIN TO ADDRESS THE CITY COUNCIL.
NALAN KARUPPAIAH: HELLO, EVERYONE. YEAH. THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY.
NALAN KARUPPAIAH: YOU, YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN, YOU KNOW, REALLY SUPPORTIVE AND DOING GREAT JOB, YOU KNOW, SUPPORTING THE CRICKET AROUND THE AREA. I LIKE TO EMPHASIZE ON THE CRICKET AND HAVING, YOU KNOW SCOTIA ON THE FIELD. I'M AN ACTIVE MEMBER IN THE NCCA PLAYING FOR ALMOST 8 YEARS NOW.
NALAN KARUPPAIAH: AND ESPECIALLY THE YOUTH PLAYERS AND KIDS. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A STRATEGY ON THE FIELD SOMETIME TO TRAVEL TOO FAR. THAT'S THE POINT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE. AND
NALAN KARUPPAIAH: YOU KNOW, GIVE SOME IMPORTANCE ON THE EXPANDING THE SKILLS, AND THAT WILL REALLY HELP THE THE ENGLISH GENERATION TO, YOU KNOW.
NALAN KARUPPAIAH: THANK YOU. THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY HERE.
NEXT UP IS HAYAGI. YOU'VE BEEN UNMUTED, AND YOU HAVE 1 MIN TO ADDRESS THE CITY COUNCIL.
THYAGY: I JUST WANTED TO LIKE. ADD TO THIS POINT, WHICH WAS SPOKEN AHEAD OF ME. ONE THING I'VE REALLY NOTICED IS SUNNYVALE HAS DEMONSTRATED A GREAT STRONG COMMITMENT TOWARDS VARIOUS SPORTS. ONE THING WAS VERY OBVIOUS WAS, WE HAVE A GOOD 30, PLUS BASEBALL DIAMONDS
THYAGY: ACROSS SUNNYVILLE, BUT GIVEN, THERE ARE LIKE A GOOD 23% OF POPULATION WHICH PLAYS OR FOLLOWS CRICKET, I FIND THE AMOUNT OF FACILITIES IN TERMS OF
THYAGY: GROUNDS OR PITCH. THAT KIND OF FALLS SHORT. SO I THINK AUTOGA IS THE ONLY ONE CRICKET GROUND FACILITY WE HAVE. SO I WOULD REALLY ADVOCATE FOR MORE CRICKET FACILITIES WHICH WILL DEFINITELY IMPROVE MORE PARTICIPATION.
THYAGY: AND ALSO WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT SINCE I'VE SEEN OTHER FACILITIES ACROSS PERIOD, THOSE ARE. MOST OF THEM ARE ASTROTURF, SO GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY. IT'LL BE NICE IF WE GET LIKE A GRASS FIELD WITH SUCH AS TRUE GRASS WOULD BE SUPER HELPFUL. SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE POINTS I WOULD LIKE THE MEMBERS TO CONSIDER
THYAGY: FOR EMPHASIZING.
THYAGY: YEAH, THE BENEFIT.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT, WE HAVE 2 SPECIAL ORDERS TODAY. SO LET ME COME UP TO THE LECTERN
BEFORE WE CONTINUE TONIGHT'S MEETING.
I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT FOR A SPECIAL RECOGNITION.
WE HAVE A SPECIAL GUEST IN RECOGNITION FOR SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING PREVENTION MONTH PARALLEL FLORES, IF SHE'S HERE.
AND I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HER.
SORRY SHE SHE ISN'T ABLE TO MAKE IT. BUT JANUARY WAS 1ST DECLARED NATIONAL SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING PREVENTION MONTH IN 2010
THIS MONTH CULMINATES IN THE ANNUAL OBSERVATION OF NATIONAL FREEDOM DAY ON FEBRUARY FIRST, ST
WHICH HONORS THE SIGNING BY PRESIDENT ABRAHAM LINCOLN OF THE JOINT HOUSE AND SENATE RESOLUTION THAT WOULD LATER BECOME THE 13TH AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION.
TONIGHT WE HONOR THOSE WHO WORK TIRELESSLY, TIRELESSLY, TO COMBAT WHAT IS CONSIDERED MODERN DAY SLAVERY.
AS WELL AS THOSE WHO ARE VICTIMS, SURVIVORS, AND ALL OF THOSE WHO ARE AFFECTED BY SLAVERY IN ANY FORM
IN HONOR OF THE ORGANIZATIONS LIKE SOUTH BAY COALITION, TO END HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN AN APPRECIATION FOR THE WORK THAT OUR DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY PERFORMS EVERY DAY IN PRESERVING THE SAFETY AND WELL-BEING OF OUR RESIDENTS AND OUR COMMUNITY. I HEREBY PROCLAIM THE MONTH OF JANUARY AS SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING PREVENTION MONTH IN THE CITY OF SUNNYVALE, AND I URGE ALL RESIDENTS TO RECOGNIZE THE VITAL ROLE THEY PLAY
IN ENDING HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND FORCED LABOR.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, AND WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT PERILLA GETS THIS PRESENTATION, THIS CERTIFICATE LATER
FOR OUR SECOND RECOGNITION TONIGHT I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO RECOGNIZE MUSLIM AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH.
THIS MONTH WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF OUR MUSLIM AMERICAN COMMUNITY.
SINCE THE TURN OF THE CENTURY
OUR NATION HAS HAD MANY MUSLIM AMERICANS BECOME TRAILBLAZERS LIKE KEITH ELLISON, THE 1ST MUSLIM AMERICAN TO SERVE IN CONGRESS, ELECTED IN 2,006
TO MAHERESHALA ALI, THE 1ST MUSLIM AMERICAN, TO WIN AN OSCAR IN 2017, AND TO OUR OWN COUNCIL, MEMBER, OMAR DEEN, THE 1ST MUSLIM AMERICAN TO SERVE ON OUR SUNNYVALE CITY COUNCIL, ELECTED IN 2020.
HOWEVER, MUSLIM AMERICANS HAVE BEEN
AN INTEGRAL PART, AND OFTEN OVERLOOKED PART OF OUR COMMUNITY SINCE THE 17TH CENTURY, WHEN SLAVES WITH MUSLIM HERITAGE WERE 1ST BROUGHT TO OUR SHORES.
AS CENTURIES PASSED. LIKE MANY OF OUR OTHER FOREBEARS, MUSLIMS CHOSE TO IMMIGRATE HERE, SEEKING ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL OPPORTUNITY, RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, AND A CHANCE TO JOIN AND CONTRIBUTE TO OUR AMERICAN SOCIETY.
THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE VAST AND HAVE ENRICHED OUR AMERICAN LANDSCAPE. MUSLIM AMERICANS ARE HEALTHCARE WORKERS, TEACHERS AND STUDENTS, ARTISTS AND ENTERTAINERS, ENTREPRENEURS, COMMUNITY LEADERS AND ORGANIZERS, MILITARY PERSONNEL POLITICIANS AND OUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS
JOINING US TONIGHT ARE MARWAN, MUSTAFA AND NUHA KHAN WITH THE MUSLIM AMERICAN COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION OF THE BAY AREA. PLEASE COME FORWARD.
MARWAN IS PART OF THE CIVIC ENGAGEMENT TEAM, AND NUHA IS BOTH AN ACTIVE MEMBER AND A PROUD POLITICAL SCIENCE STUDENT IN MISSION COLLEGE. I'LL COME ON ON THIS SIDE, AND ANYONE WHO WANTS TO COME FORWARD, AND I WILL NOW PASS IT ON TO NUHA TO SAY A FEW WORDS.
GOOD EVENING, ASSEMBLY, AND GOOD EVENING, MAYOR KLEIN AND COUNCIL MEMBERS MAY PEACE BE UPON YOU
AS MUSLIMS. OFTENTIMES WE ARE PORTRAYED IN A NEGATIVE LIGHT ON SOCIAL MEDIA, TELEVISION, AND EVEN SCHOOL CURRICULUMS.
MUSLIMS, HOWEVER, ARE THE KINDEST AND MOST EDUCATED PEOPLE YOU WILL EVER MEET.
OUR COMMUNITY IS FILLED WITH TEACHERS, DOCTORS, ENGINEERS, AND EVEN CIVIC SERVANTS, WHO DO INCREDIBLE WORK LIKE DISTRIBUTING DOZENS OF MEALS EVERY SINGLE WEEK TO THE NEEDY.
JUST LIKE WHAT I MENTIONED, THERE ARE STILL MANY MORE IMPORTANT ROLES THAT WE, AS MUSLIMS, FULFILL IN ORDER TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SUCCESS OF SOCIETY, AS WE HAVE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME
MANY PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW BUT THE WORLD'S 1ST UNIVERSITY THAT IS STILL RUNNING WAS FOUNDED BY A MUSLIM WOMAN.
A MUSLIM SCHOLAR BY THE NAME OF KHAWARIZMI, WAS THE FOUNDER OF ALGEBRA.
AND ON A MORE RECENT NOTE, MUSLIMS, SUCH AS MALCOLM X. HAVE BEEN ON THE FOREFRONT OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. AND EVEN TODAY.
UNFORTUNATELY, I'M SURE MANY OF YOU DID NOT KNOW THIS, BECAUSE OUR AMERICAN EDUCATION SYSTEM BARELY SCRATCHES THE SURFACE OF ISLAM AND ITS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE WORLD
ALONG WITH THAT. UNFORTUNATELY, BEING MUSLIM AMERICAN MEANS THAT OUR FREEDOM OF SPEECH IS LIMITED.
WE CANNOT PROTEST WITHOUT BEING TEAR GASSED OR ARRESTED. WE CANNOT ADVOCATE FOR OUR COMMUNITY WITHOUT BEING REMOVED FROM SCHOOLS OR FIRED FROM WORK. WE CANNOT LOBBY WITHOUT BIG MONEY INTEREST GROUPS SHUTTING DOWN OUR EFFORTS. WE CANNOT EVEN LEAVE THE HOUSE WEARING HIJABS OR KIFAYAS WITHOUT PEOPLE MAKING ATROCIOUS COMMENTS, SUCH AS TERRORIST
BEING MUSLIM AMERICAN MEANS THAT YOU ARE ACCUSTOMED TO BULLYING DISCRIMINATION SIMPLY FOR EXISTING.
THESE AGGRESSIONS TOWARDS THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY HAVE HAVE EXISTED THROUGHOUT MY WHOLE LIFE, AND HAVE BECOME A VERY DIFFICULT REALITY. MANY PEOPLE LIKE ME MUST FACE.
AND THE WORST PART IS IS THAT THESE AGGRESSIONS HAVE ESCALATED IN THE PAST 18 MONTHS WITH THE ONGOING GENOCIDE IN PALESTINE.
DESPITE THE RECENT CALL FOR A CEASEFIRE. PALESTINIAN LAND IS STILL ILLEGALLY OCCUPIED. PALESTINIANS HAVE BEEN DENIED MEDICAL AID, AND THE RIGHT TO RETURN TO THEIR HOMES. PALESTINIANS ARE STILL BEING MURDERED.
AND WHILE MUSLIMS ARE SUFFERING IN ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD, SUCH AS KASHMIR, INDIA, SUDAN, AND CHINA, WE ARE PARTICULARLY DISTURBED BY THE UNITED STATES FOR BEING THE BIGGEST ENABLER IN THE GENOCIDE TOWARDS PALESTINIANS.
OUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS SHOULD BE SHOULD NOT BE USED TO FUND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY.
THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY ASKS THE CITY OF SUNNYVILLE TO DIVEST FROM COMPANIES AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT INVEST IN THE APARTHEID STATE OF ISRAEL. WE ASK THAT YOU INVEST MORE IN ADVANCING MUSLIM REPRESENTATION IN SCHOOLS, POLITICS OR ANYWHERE THAT OUR VOICE AND HISTORY MAY BE HEARD.
I HOPE THAT AS OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS, YOU TAKE MY VOICE AND REALITY AS A MUSLIM TO MAKE EFFECTIVE CHANGE FOR MY PEOPLE. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
AND SO THANK YOU. MARWAN AND NUHA, ON BEHALF OF SUNNYVALE CITY COUNCIL. IT'S MY HONOR TO PROCLAIM. JANUARY 2025, AS MUSLIM AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH. ENCOURAGE ALL SUNNYVALE RESIDENTS, BUSINESSES, STUDENTS, AND NEIGHBORS TO RECOGNIZE AND LEARN THE MANY CONTRIBUTIONS OF OUR MUSLIM AMERICAN COMMUNITY. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. APPRECIATE IT.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I HAVE SEVERAL SPEAKERS. 1ST UP IS KAMAL, FOLLOWED BY MARWAN. N.
IS IT WORKING? OH, YES, IT'S WORKING.
GOOD EVENING.
AND SO, PLEASE, GAMING. I MEAN, LIKE, WHAT I WANTED TO SHARE TODAY IS REALLY JUST SHARING A STORY. IT'S JUST THANK YOU 1ST FOR RECOGNIZING THE MUSLIM HERITAGE MONTH. WE REALLY REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. AND I'M PALESTINIAN. I JUST FELT LIKE SHARING A STORY WITH YOU TODAY. IT'S A STORY OF A CHILD. IT'S A BIT OF A SAD STORY, SO I HOPE THAT YOU BEAR WITH ME.
IT'S JUST A POINT LIKE A MOMENT OF REMEMBRANCE THAT I HOPE THAT I COULD SHARE WITH YOU.
IT'S A STORY OF A 10 YEAR OLD PALESTINIAN CHILD, AZMI ABUSHAR AZMI IS HIS NAME. HE USED HIS PHONE TO WRITE HIS FINAL WORDS BEFORE. KIND OF LIKE BEING MARTYRED
IN AN ISRAELI AIRSTRIKE ON HIS FAMILY'S HOME, AND HE WROTE.
PEACE BE UPON YOU IF I SLEEP, AND THE SLEEP TAKES ME.
FORGIVE ME, MY MOTHER, FATHER, AND MY SIBLINGS. NAIM MASHAD, MARYAM, AND MAHMOUD.
MAMA AND BABA. I AM SO SORRY IF I EVER UPSET YOU.
I AM AZUS, THAT'S HIS NAME.
HIS NICKNAME, AND I FEEL I WON'T LIVE LONG.
HE CONTINUED, ADDRESSING HIS FAMILY. MAMA, PLEASE TAKE CARE OF MAHMOUD. NAIMA, THESE ARE HIS SIBLINGS. I AM SORRY FOR ANY TROUBLE I CAUSED YOU.
AND THE SAME GOES FOR SHAHAD AND MARIAM.
I LOVE YOU ALL, MY GRANDMA, GRANDPA, UNCLES, AUNTS, AND EVERYONE. I HOPE YOU ALL FORGIVE ME.
AZMI'S MESSAGE IS NOT JUST THE FAREWELL OF A CHILD. IT'S A TESTIMONY OF AN UNIMAGINABLE SUFFERING FACED BY THE GAZA CHILDREN. PALESTINE OVERALL, I MEAN, LIKE THE SAME IS TAKING PLACE RIGHT NOW IN THE WEST BANK.
DURING THE 15 MONTH
LONG US BACKED ATTACK AND ETHNIC CLEANSING GENOCIDE, WHATEVER WE WANT TO CALL IT. OVER 18,000 CHILDREN LOST THEIR LIVES.
HIS WORDS ARE A PLEA TO THE WORLD TO REMEMBER, TO RECOGNIZE THEIR SUFFERING AND TO ACT. WE CANNOT LET THEIR VOICES BE SILENCED. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH, REALLY, FOR THIS, AND I JUST WANTED TO END BY SAYING, ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS. WE REALLY REALLY APPRECIATE THE RECOGNITION. IT'S A GREAT STEP
TOWARDS KIND OF RECOGNIZING MUSLIMS AND BRINGING EVERYONE IN AN INTEGRAL IN THE KIND OF LIKE THE INTEGRAL FABRIC OF THE COMMUNITY. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
THANK YOU. NEXT UP IS MARWAN, N.
FOLLOWED BY MARK ORDELL.
THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR, AND THANK YOU. HONORABLE COUNCIL MEMBERS. I DON'T WANT TO BE TAKING TOO MUCH OF YOUR TIME, AND I THINK A LOT HAS BEEN SAID ALREADY. I APPRECIATE YOUR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND HONORING OF THE JANUARY AS A MUSLIM AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH.
THE THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY IS GOING THROUGH
A LOT RIGHT NOW, BOTH LOCALLY AND GLOBALLY.
SEEING A LOT OF CHANGES AND A LOT OF LEADERSHIP COMING AROUND SOON SOME LATER THAN
WE NEED IT, BUT WE APPRECIATE THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.
WE LOOK FORWARD FOR THE COMING
A NUMBER OF YEARS UNDER THE NEW ADMINISTRATION AND UNDER THE CHANGES IN THE POLITICAL SCENE
TO SEE MORE PEOPLE COMING TOGETHER, MORE UNDERSTANDING AND INCLUSIVITY
AS THE WAVE GETS HIGHER. I HOPE WE RISE HIGHER THAN IT.
AND I APPRECIATE YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.
NEXT IS MARGARET L. FOLLOWED BY UDAY.
HI, I'M MARGARET LAWSON. EXCUSE ME.
IN THE PANTHEON OF THE WORLD'S ISSUES AND PROBLEMS. THIS IS PRETTY MINOR, BUT
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE PEOPLE BEHIND ME IF THEY CAN READ YOUR NAMES.
CAN YOU SEE THEM.
ANYWAY? MY ISSUE, MY SMALL COMPLAINT HERE IS THAT WE CANNOT SEE YOUR NAMES. YOU'RE ALL ELECTED OFFICIALS. YOU LIKE TO HAVE YOUR NAMES OUT THERE, AND SO I'D LIKE TO SEE SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING ABOUT
FIXING THE NAME SO WE CAN TELL WHO YOU ARE, ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE 2 NEW COUNCIL MEMBERS, AND PEOPLE AREN'T AS FAMILIAR WITH THEM.
AND THAT IS MY ONE, MY SMALL ISSUE. TODAY I'VE GOT OTHERS IF YOU WANT TO HEAR THEM. BUT THIS IS JUST ONE THING. I THINK, THAT THIS SHOULD BE TAKEN CARE OF. THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL BUILDING. IT'S IT'S 1 FLAW WE CAN'T READ YOUR NAMES.
THANK YOU.
NEXT UP IS UDAY, FOLLOWED BY SIVA.
TAKE A LOOK.
CAN I GET?
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. CITY COUNCIL. THANK YOU, MAYOR. GOOD SEEING YOU AGAIN. WISH YOU A HAPPY NEW YEAR TO EVERYONE WELCOME TO
CONSULMAN CHANG AND CONSULMAN LEE. WELL, YOU CAN READ FROM HERE.
I. YOU KNOW WE WE WANTED TO WELCOME YOU TO SUNNYVALE, TO THE CITY COUNCIL. I REPRESENT, OR I'M PART OF
A GROUP WE CALL OURSELVES A CHILD. STRAIGHT COALITION WE ARE
THE COMMUNITY WE LIVE IN CHARLES STREET, WHICH IS RIGHT ACROSS WHERE WE ARE SITTING
RIGHT ACROSS THIS BUILDING.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY TALKED TO THE CITY COUNCIL, AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT THAT WE'VE GOTTEN FROM MAYOR, FROM RICHARD.
FROM EVERYONE HERE. AND WE WANTED TO BRING TO ATTENTION ONE OF THE PROJECTS THAT IS ACTUALLY TAKING PLACE, OR IS PROPOSED ON OUR STREET RIGHT? SO WE LIVE ON CHARLES STREET, AND I'VE BEEN A SUNNYVALE RESIDENT FOR 25 YEARS NOW.
AND ON OUR STREET OVER THE PAST, YOU KNOW, 5 TO 10 YEARS WE'VE SEEN AROUND 900 NEW RESIDENTS BEING PLACED. SO YOU KNOW. 1ST PROJECT WAS THE 4 20, YOU KNOW, 4, 28,
WHICH HAS 140 UNITS, AND THEN THE MAXWELL PROJECT.
THEN THE MERIDIAN PROJECT. ALTOGETHER IT'S AROUND 900 NEW HOUSEHOLDS THAT WERE ADDED, AND PROBABLY MORE INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE ADDED TO ONE SMALL BLOCK OF THE CITY.
I CAN BET YOU MY MONEY THAT YOU WILL NOT FIND PARKING ON CHARLES STREET. IF YOU GO OUT THERE TODAY, OR ON ANY OTHER DAYS.
IT HAS BECOME EXTREMELY CROWDED. YOU WILL SEE MY NEIGHBORS. WE HAVE TAKEN SOME PICTURES HERE FOR YOUR IDENTIFICATION.
THERE IS A LOT OF TRASH ON THE STREET
THE STREET HAS BECOME EXTREMELY CROWDED, AND BECAUSE THERE IS NO SPACE FOR THE STREET PEOPLE TO COME.
NOBODY REALLY CLEANS THE STREETS OTHER THAN SOME OF US, YOU KNOW, STEVE, MY NEIGHBOR, AND HIS WIFE. THEY WALKED AROUND AND CLEANED THE STREET. THIS THIS WEEKEND. I SAW THEM. I YOU KNOW I WAS BUSY. I COULD NOT STOP, BUT I SAW THEM CLEANING THE STREET THEMSELVES, BECAUSE WE TAKE PRIDE IN OUR STREET. WE TAKE PRIDE IN THE CITY. WE VALUE THAT YOU ARE OUR REPRESENTATIVES. WE WANT YOU TO HELP US.
BUT THIS IS WHAT IS GOING ON IN CHARLES STREET, WHICH IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF WHERE WE ARE SITTING. HERE
THE PROPOSED PROJECT IS TO PUT ANOTHER 140 MORE UNITS IN THE WELLS FARGO SITE.
THIS TREAT I HUMBLY SUBMIT, THAT HAS DONE ENOUGH ALREADY.
900 MORE HOUSEHOLDS WERE ADDED IN THE LAST 5 YEARS, AND WE ARE PROPOSING TO ADD 140 MORE HOUSEHOLDS. WE RESPECT THAT HIGH DENSITY HOUSING IS A NEED. BUT HAVE WE DONE ENOUGH.
HOW MUCH MORE DO WE HAVE TO SUSTAIN THROUGH
HOW MUCH MORE DO THESE NEIGHBORS DO WE HAVE TO
SUFFER THROUGH TO WELCOME THE NEW NEIGHBORS TO OUR COMMUNITY. THAT IS WHAT WE WANTED TO BRING UP TO YOUR ATTENTION. WE ARE GETTING VERY GOOD SUPPORT FROM THE CITY, FROM THE MAYOR, FROM THE CITY COUNCIL, BUT JUST WANTED TO BRING THIS BACK TO YOUR ATTENTION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
AND MY LAST SPEAKER CARD IS SIVA.
ALRIGHT. WELL, I'M GOING TO SPEAK ON THIS ON THE SAME TOPIC.
I'LL YOU KNOW, AS UDAY WAS TALKING ABOUT IT.
OKAY?
YEAH, IT'S ADVANCING. THANK YOU.
YEAH. WELL.
HAPPY NEW YEAR. I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU TO GET STARTED THIS YEAR AND WELCOME TO THE COUNCIL. I SEE THE NEW SEATING ARRANGEMENT.
BUT YEAH, LET ME GET TO THE THE SAME TOPIC GIVEN THAT I HAVE A LIMITED TIME.
YOU KNOW THERE IS. THERE WAS A RECENTLY OPENED 90 UNIT
HIGH DENSITY, LOW INCOME HOUSING PROJECT THAT STARTED LAST JANUARY. SO RIGHT ABOUT ONE YEAR
AND NOW, AND THEIR PROPOSAL, WHICH IS, IF YOU LOOK AT THE RADIUS OF HALF A MILE. THE ONLY OTHER
FULLY LOW INCOME. HIGH DENSITY HOUSING PROJECT IS JUST 500 FEET FROM IT.
AND IT'S THE SAME PICTURE HERE YOU'RE SEEING THAT THAT THE PURPLE BOXES ARE THE FULLY
LOW INCOME, HIGH DENSITY PROJECTS, AND IT SEEMS LIKE THEY ARE BEING
PUT IN ONE PLACE IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD WHICH DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT IS SERVING AS IT INTEGRATES WELL WITH THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE PROPOSAL. IF YOU'RE NOT AWARE OF IT.
I'M SURE MANY OF YOU ALREADY KNOW, IS FOR 6 TO 7 STORIES GOING TO 3 STORIES.
WHILE WHAT THE DSP. WHICH IS THE DOWNTOWN SPECIFIC PLAN, THE ZONING CALLS FOR 4 STORIES GOING TO 2. CLEARLY NOT MEETING THAT STANDARD OR THE VISION PUT TOGETHER BY DSP.
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE PICTURE, IT LOOKS LIKE THAT
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ANYWHERE CLOSE TO BEING INTEGRATED, YOU KNOW, WHENEVER YOU HAVE HIGH DENSITY, LOW INCOME HOUSING PROJECTS.
YOU WOULD LIKE THEM TO BE INTEGRATED WITH THE NEIGHBORHOOD. BUT IF YOU PUT MULTIPLE OF THOSE NEXT TO EACH OTHER RIGHT NEXT TO SINGLE FAMILY HOMES DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THEY REALLY INTEGRATE. AT LEAST THIS PICTURE DOESN'T SERVE THAT PURPOSE.
AND THE DENSITY IS OFF THE CHARTS RIGHT? THE DSP. CALLS FOR ABOUT 57 UNITS FOR THAT AREA, AND I'M SURE YOU WILL POINT TO ALL THE RULES, SAYING WHAT DSP. CALLS FOR DOESN'T MATTER, BECAUSE THEY CAN GET THIS EXCEPTION. THAT EXCEPTION, THAT'S THE REALITY. SO IT LOOKS LIKE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. IT LOOKS LIKE ALL THE ZONING WORK WE DO, AND IS
OUT OF THE WINDOW LIKE THAT'S NOTHING TO DO.
ANYWAY. I'LL MOVE ON. YOU KNOW, PARKING IS AN ISSUE TO THE EXTENT THAT ON BUSY STREET BUSY DAYS PEOPLE PARK IN THE RED ZONE THEY DON'T CARE.
THEY JUST PARKED THE CAR RIGHT THERE.
TRASH IS A REGULAR THING THAT HAPPENS.
AND SO WHAT WE'RE I'M HERE TO TELL YOU IS, YOU KNOW, A NEW PROJECTS CHANGE THE NEIGHBORHOODS FOR A HUNDRED YEARS TO COME. IT'S A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE.
AND WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT. WE ACTUALLY SPOKE TO MID PENN AND SOME OF THE CITY STAFF. THEY HAVE BEEN SUPPORTIVE. WE NEED MORE OF YOUR SUPPORT.
AND THERE ARE OPTIONS WE CAN CONSIDER, AND WE WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH. YOU. THINK ABOUT SENIOR HOUSING BETTER WAYS TO INTEGRATE THE HOUSING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT WAS MY LAST SPEAKER CARD.
BEFORE WE MOVE TO ORAL COMMUNICATIONS. BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF REMOTE COMMUNICATIONS. SPEAKERS WHO ARE RULED OUT OF ORDER WILL NOT BE GIVEN ANOTHER CHANCE TO SPEAK ON THIS ITEM, THEREFORE, SPEAKERS ARE WARNED TO LIMIT THEIR COMMENTS TO SUBJECT MATTERS THAT FALL WITHIN CITY COUNCIL'S AUTHORITY TO DECIDE OR TAKE ACTION.
CITY CLERK, DO WE HAVE ANY REMOTE PARTICIPANTS WISHING TO SPEAK UNDER ORAL COMMUNICATIONS. YES, MAYOR, 1ST IS MUSA T. FOLLOWED BY STEPHEN M.
MUSA, YOU'VE BEEN UNMUTED, AND YOU HAVE 3 MIN TO ADDRESS THE CITY COUNCIL.
MUSA TARIQ, CAIR-SFBA: HELLO! CAN YOU HEAR ME?
YES, WE CAN.
MUSA TARIQ, CAIR-SFBA: PERFECT. HELLO, HONORABLE COUNCIL MEMBERS. I'M MUSA WITH CARE. THE COUNCIL ON AMERICAN ISLAMIC RELATIONS, AND YOUR NEIGHBOR OVER IN SANTA CLARA. WE WANTED TO ECHO THE SUNNYVALE MUSLIM COMMUNITY, AND THANKING THE CITY OF SUNNYVILLE FOR RECOGNIZING MUSLIM AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH.
MUSA TARIQ, CAIR-SFBA: MUSLIM HERITAGE HAS ENRICHED SUNNYVALE IN COUNTLESS WAYS FROM SMALL BUSINESSES TO COMMUNITY SERVICE EDUCATION AND MORE MUSLIMS HAVE BEEN AN INTEGRAL PART OF THIS COMMUNITY AND THIS COUNTRY'S FABRIC FROM THE VERY BEGINNING, INCLUDING AFRICAN MUSLIMS, WHO WERE FORCIBLY TAKEN FROM THEIR HOMELANDS AND ENSLAVED AND CREATED THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES ITSELF.
MUSA TARIQ, CAIR-SFBA: WHILE THIS PROCLAMATION IS APPRECIATED AND NEEDED, I ALSO WANT TO ECHO THE COMMUNITY'S DEMAND FOR AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE PAIN AND FEAR SUNNYVALE, MUSLIMS AND PALESTINIANS HAVE FACED, DUE TO THE ONGOING GENOCIDE IN GAZA, AS WE SPEAK IN GAZA HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED, INNOCENT MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN, ENTIRE FAMILIES WIPED OUT, TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN LEFT ORPHANED, AND MOST OF GAZA'S INFRASTRUCTURE DECIMATED, AND THERE HAVE BEEN REPERCUSSIONS AT HOME HERE IN SUNNYVALE, AS WELL.
FOCUS ON. SORRY, I UNDERSTAND. CAN YOU FOCUS ON THINGS WITHIN OUR SUBJECT MATTER? JURISDICTION? I APPRECIATE.
MUSA TARIQ, CAIR-SFBA: I WAS JUST SPEAKING TO THE MUSLIM HERITAGE MONTH PROCLAMATION. I'LL KEEP IT BRIEF.
MUSA TARIQ, CAIR-SFBA: MUSLIM HERITAGE IS ROOTED IN JUSTICE AND STANDING AGAINST OPPRESSION. THE LEGACY OF MALCOLM X. REMINDS US THAT JUSTICE IS THE FOUNDATION OF PEACE, AND WE WANT TO THANK THE CITY ONCE AGAIN FOR RECOGNIZING MUSLIM HERITAGE MONTH, AND WE URGE THE CITY TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP AND DIVEST FROM COMPANIES SUPPORTING ISRAEL'S APARTHEID, AND TO PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGE THE PAIN THAT THE SUNNYVILLE MUSLIM COMMUNITY HAS ENDURED. ONCE AGAIN WE WANT TO RECOGNIZE OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS IN SUNNYVILLE AND THANK THE CITY OF SUNNYVILLE FOR RECOGNIZING ITS ROBUST AND DIVERSE MUSLIM COMMUNITY. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
NEXT UP IS STEPHEN M. FOLLOWED BY UDAY D. STEPHEN, YOU'VE BEEN UNMUTED, AND YOU HAVE 3 MIN TO ADDRESS THE CITY COUNCIL.
STEPHEN MEIER: HELLO! GOOD EVENING, CITY COUNCIL.
STEPHEN MEIER: THANKS FOR YOUR ATTENTION TONIGHT.
STEPHEN MEIER: UNFORTUNATELY, I WANTED TO JUST DISCUSS THE PEDESTRIAN DEATH THAT HAPPENED RECENTLY ON FAIR OAKS AVENUE.
STEPHEN MEIER: APPARENTLY JANUARY 18.TH THERE WAS A PEDESTRIAN STRUCK BY A VEHICLE AT FAIR OAKS IN COLUMBIA.
STEPHEN MEIER: SO THIS SHOULD REALLY BRING PRIORITY AND ATTENTION TO THE STUDY ISSUE FOR COMPLETE STREETS ON FAIR OAKS.
STEPHEN MEIER: AND IF THERE'S ANY WAY THAT PUBLIC WORKS CAN GO FASTER
STEPHEN MEIER: AND PRIORITIZE ACTION OVER ANALYSIS, IT WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED BECAUSE WE HAVE THESE LIKE STUDY ISSUES THAT SEEM TO JUST TAKE A LOT OF RESOURCES, PARTICULARLY ENDLESS STUDIES ABOUT PARKING ANALYSIS.
STEPHEN MEIER: AND THEN, WHEN IT COMES UP AND YOU BRING IT TO THE CITIZENS.
STEPHEN MEIER: THEY DON'T VALUE YOUR STUDIES. SO WE'RE SPENDING A LOT OF TIME, A LOT OF RESOURCES DOING ANALYSIS, PARALYSIS WHEN MEANWHILE CITIZENS ARE BEING STRUCK BY VEHICLES.
STEPHEN MEIER: SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO GO FASTER, I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT. THAT'S THE END OF MY COMMENTS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION. GOOD NIGHT.
THANK YOU.
NEXT UP IS UDAY D UDAY. YOU'VE BEEN UNMUTED, AND YOU HAVE 3 MIN TO ADDRESS THE CITY COUNCIL.
UDAY DEVASPER: HELLO, CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS. MY NAME IS SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE COMMUNITY WITH REGARD TO A TOPIC THAT I BELIEVE MAY HAVE BEEN SPOKEN ABOUT BEFORE. THIS IS RELATED TO THE CREATION OF THE CRICKET GROUND IN THE LAST PALMAS FIELDS. I APOLOGIZE THAT I COULDN'T BE PART OF THE DISCUSSION EARLIER, SINCE I HAD NOT GOTTEN OFF WORK YET. I APPRECIATE THE TIME THAT YOU'RE PROVIDING ME.
UDAY DEVASPER: I'LL JUST ADD A FEW COMMENTS. I'VE BEEN IN THE BAY AREA FOR ALMOST 20 YEARS NOW, AN AVID CRICKET PLAYER. IT'S A SPORT THAT IS NEWER TO THE US. BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF TEAMS, A LOT OF PLAYERS AND A LOT OF WELL WISHERS OF THE COMMUNITY THAT REALLY ENJOY THE SPORT.
UDAY DEVASPER: YOU KNOW. SPORT IN GENERAL, I'VE SEEN HAS ALWAYS BROUGHT COMMUNITIES TOGETHER. IT BRINGS A SENSE OF, YOU KNOW, PLAYING TOGETHER THE SPORT. IT JUST TEACHES A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DISCIPLINE, AND I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE IF COMMUNITIES CAN SUPPORT NEW SPORTS, IT'LL JUST HELP COMMUNITIES GROW WELCOME. MORE PEOPLE. I GENUINELY FEEL LIKE CRICKET AS A SPORT WILL GROW IN THE US.
UDAY DEVASPER: WITH IT BEING INCLUDED IN THE LA OLYMPICS. IT'S GOING TO GET EVEN MORE PROMINENCE. THE US. DID REALLY WELL IN THE JUST RECENTLY CONCLUDED WORLD CUP.
UDAY DEVASPER: AND I THINK THAT IT'S GREAT TO BE ABLE TO BUILD ON THE MOMENTUM. WE HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS FROM THE SOUTH ASIAN COMMUNITY THAT
UDAY DEVASPER: PLAY CRICKET, AND WE'D LIKE FOR CRICKET TO ACTUALLY SPREAD TO, NOT JUST THE SOUTH ASIAN COMMUNITY, BUT EVERYBODY ELSE WHO CAN ENJOY A SPORT SIMILAR TO BASEBALL. SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE CITY COUNCIL TO LOOK AT THE PROPOSAL TO BUILD A CRICKET GROUND IN LAS PALMAS. IT WOULD DEFINITELY HELP THE SPORT ON A PERSONAL NOTE. I WOULD APPRECIATE IT BECAUSE IT WILL ALLOW US TO CONTINUE TO GROW IT IN THE COMMUNITY OVER HERE. SO AGAIN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.
UDAY DEVASPER: I APOLOGIZE THAT I'M BRINGING UP A TOPIC THAT MAY HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED EARLIER, BUT REALLY APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE TIME OR GIVING ME THE TIME TO SPEAK ABOUT THIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

OUR 1ST ITEM TONIGHT IS, ITEM 25, 0 1, 9, 9, GENERAL PLAN AND ZONING AMENDMENTS RELATED TO STUDY ISSUE. CDD, 23. 0, 2. CHANGE THE GENERAL PLAN, LAND USE DESIGNATIONS AND REZONE MULTIPLE PROPERTIES. IS THERE A STAFF REPORT?
GOOD EVENING, HONORABLE MAYOR. MEMBERS OF THE CITY COUNCIL? MY NAME IS WENDY LAU, ASSOCIATE PLANNER.
THE ITEM FOR YOU THIS EVENING IS A GENERAL PLAN, SPECIFIC PLAN AND ZONING AMENDMENT TO SUPPORT RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE CITY OF SUNNYVALE
STAFF WOULD LIKE TO 1ST PROVIDE SOME BACKGROUND TO EXPLAIN THE REASONS FOR THE PROPOSED CHANGES.
CURRENTLY, THERE ARE SOME BUILDINGS WITH EXISTING USES THAT DO NOT MATCH THE UNDERLYING ZONING OR GENERAL PLAN. LAND USE DESIGNATIONS.
FOR EXAMPLE, THERE ARE SEVERAL SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCES WHICH HAVE EXISTED FOR A LONG TIME LOCATED IN THE OFFICE ZONING DISTRICT.
IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO ALIGN THE EXISTING USES WITH THE ZONING AND GENERAL PLAN LAND USE DESIGNATIONS.
THIS WILL ALLOW PROPERTY OWNERS THE ABILITY TO MAXIMIZE REDEVELOPMENT OR EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE ZONING DISTRICT'S REDEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
FOR EXAMPLE, THE SINGLE FAMILY HOME IN THE PROPER RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICT WOULD NOW BE ABLE TO ADD A NECESSARY DWELLING UNIT OR ADU.
THESE CHANGES WOULD SUPPORT RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT. TO ADDRESS THE JOBS. HOUSING RATIO
ON THE SCREEN IS AN OVERVIEW OF TONIGHT'S PRESENTATION.
THERE ARE ESSENTIALLY 4 CATEGORIES OF CHANGES. I WILL BE GOING OVER EACH CATEGORY, ONE AT A TIME.
FIRST, ST WE WILL DISCUSS ZONING GENERAL PLAN AND SPECIFIC PLAN AMENDMENTS TO 27 LEGAL NONCONFORMING SINGLE FAMILY AND 2 FAMILY RESIDENCES.
THE SECOND CATEGORY WE WILL BE DISCUSSING IS THE REZONING OF SITES IN THE INDUSTRIAL TO RESIDENTIAL OR ITR COMBINING DISTRICT TO RESIDENTIAL.
THE 3RD CATEGORY WE WILL BE DISCUSSING IS THE REZONING OF 3 INDUSTRIAL ZONED SITES TO ITR
SOME OF THESE SITES ARE LOCATED IN AN AREA WHERE ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION MAY BE A POTENTIAL CONCERN WHICH STAFF WILL DISCUSS IN MORE DETAILS LATER.
LASTLY, THE 4TH CATEGORY WE WILL BE DISCUSSING IS ZONING CODE TEXT AMENDMENTS FOR ITR ZONE SITES.
THE 1ST CATEGORY IS FOR SINGLE FAMILY AND 2 FAMILY RESIDENCES.
THERE ARE 27 LEGAL, NONCONFORMING, RESIDENTIAL SITES IN NON-RESIDENTIAL LAND USE AND ZONING DISTRICTS.
THE EXISTING GENERAL PLAN, LAND USE DESIGNATION FOR THESE SITES RANGE FROM OFFICE TO EL CAMINO RIO SPECIFIC PLAN TO PERRY PARK SPECIFIC PLAN DESIGNATIONS.
THE EXISTING ZONING DESIGNATIONS RANGE FROM OFFICE WITH A PLANNED DEVELOPMENT COMBINING DISTRICT TO EL CAMINO, REAL COMMERCIAL
TO PERRY PARK SPECIFIC PLAN, MIXED INDUSTRY CORE.
ADDITIONALLY, SOME SITES ARE LOCATED WITHIN THE EL CAMINO RIA SPECIFIC PLAN OR PERRY PARK SPECIFIC PLAN AREAS.
STAFF IS PROPOSING TO CHANGE THE GENERAL PLAN, LAND USE DESIGNATION TO RESIDENTIAL LOW DENSITY OR RESIDENTIAL LOW MEDIUM DENSITY.
THE ZONING WOULD ALSO CHANGE TO R. 0 R. 2 OR R. 2 WITH AN OFFICE COMBINING DISTRICT WHICH ALIGNS WITH THE PROPOSED GENERAL PLAN, LAND USE DESIGNATION.
THIS WOULD ALSO RESULT IN THE REMOVAL OF SEVERAL SITES FROM THE EL CAMINO. REAL SPECIFIC PLAN AND PERRY PARK SPECIFIC PLAN.
ON THE SCREEN ARE MAPS SHOWING THE LOCATION OF 27 AFFECTED SITES.
THESE SINGLE FAMILY AND 2 FAMILY DWELLINGS ARE LOCATED ALONG CHARLES STREET, FLORENCE STREET, NORTH PASTORIA AVENUE, OXFALL COURT, SOUTH MURPHY AVENUE, WEST IOWA AVENUE AND WAVERLEY STREET.
THE BLUE REPRESENTS THE PROPOSED LOW DENSITY, RESIDENTIAL ZONING, AND GENERAL PLAN, LAND USE, DESIGNATION, AND THE RED REPRESENTS LOW MEDIUM DENSITY, RESIDENTIAL ZONING, AND GENERAL PLAN, LAND USE, DESIGNATION.
THE GREEN HATCHED OVERLAY WHICH AFFECTS JUST ONE PROPERTY AT 5 9 1 SOUTH MURPHY AVENUE REPRESENTS OFFICE COMBINING ZONING DISTRICT.
THE SECOND CATEGORY WE WILL BE DISCUSSING IS THE REZONING OF SITES WITHIN THE ITR COMBINING DISTRICT TO RESIDENTIAL
AS BACKGROUND. IN 1993 THE CITY CREATED THE ITR COMBINING DISTRICT TO IDENTIFY UNDERUTILIZED LAND FOR POTENTIAL REDEVELOPMENT WITH HOUSING
AND TO HELP ADDRESS THE JOBS HOUSING, IMBALANCE.
PRESENTLY MANY OF THESE SITES HAVE BEEN REDEVELOPED INTO MULTIFAMILY RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS.
THE CITY'S GENERAL PLAN, LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION ELEMENT HAS AN ACTION STATEMENT TO REZONE TRANSITION NEIGHBORHOODS FROM ITR TO APPROPRIATE RESIDENTIAL ZONING
ON THE SCREEN IS A MAP SHOWING THE LOCATIONS OF THESE ITR SITES THAT HAVE NOW BEEN REDEVELOPED WITH MULTIFAMILY RESIDENCES
BECAUSE THEY WERE CREATED UNDER THE R 3 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS WITH A PLANNED DEVELOPMENT COMBINING DISTRICT STAFF IS PROPOSING TO REMOVE THE INDUSTRIAL OR COMMERCIAL WITH ITR. ZONING DESIGNATION AND MAINTAIN THE R. 3 PD. ZONING DESIGNATION.
THE EXISTING GENERAL PLAN, LAND USE, DESIGNATION, ARE RESIDENTIAL MEDIUM OR RESIDENTIAL HIGH, AND WOULD REMAIN, AS IS
THE 3RD CATEGORY WE WILL BE DISCUSSING IS THE REZONING OF 3 INDUSTRIAL ZONED SITES TO ITR
FOR BACKGROUND. THESE SITES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED FOR REDEVELOPMENT, FOR RESIDENTIAL USE IN THE LATEST GENERAL PLAN HOUSING ELEMENT.
THESE SITES ARE LOCATED IN THE EAST SUNNYVALE AREA AND COMBINED, THEY TOTAL 30 ACRES.
THEY ARE CURRENTLY ZONED INDUSTRIAL SERVICE OR MS. YET HAVE A GENERAL PLAN. LAND USE DESIGNATION OF MEDIUM DENSITY RESIDENTIAL.
THERE IS A HOUSING ELEMENT PROGRAM TO REZONE THESE SITES TO MEDIUM DENSITY RESIDENTIAL, WHICH IS BEING PROPOSED THIS EVENING.
FOR CONTEXT, THIS MAP ON THE SCREEN SHOWS IN RED OUTLINE THE SITES IN THE EAST SUNNYVALE AREA THAT ARE PROPOSED TO BE REZONED TO RESIDENTIAL USE.
THE EXISTING GENERAL PLAN. LAND USE DESIGNATION OF THESE SITES IS RESIDENTIAL MEDIUM DENSITY SHOWN IN BROWN.
AND SUPPORTS 15 TO 24 DWELLING UNITS PER ACRE.
THE EXISTING ZONING DESIGNATION IS INDUSTRIAL SERVICE, OR MS.
ONLY SITES 1, 2, AND 3 ARE PROPOSED TO BE REZONED. AT THIS TIME.
SITES 4, 5, AND 6 ARE NOT CURRENTLY PROPOSED FOR REZONING, DUE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION OR DEED RESTRICTIONS THAT PROHIBIT RESIDENTIAL USE UNTIL ADEQUATE CLEANUP HAS OCCURRED.
AS A RESULT, STAFF IS PROPOSING TO CHANGE THE ZONING FOR SITES, 1, 2, AND 3 BY ADDING THE ITR. R. 3 AND PD. COMBINING DISTRICTS RESULTING IN MS. ITR. R. 3 PD. ZONING.
THIS WOULD ALLOW FOR FUTURE REDEVELOPMENT OF THESE SITES, RESULTING IN APPROXIMATELY 116 NEW RESIDENTIAL UNITS.
THE GENERAL PLAN LAND USE WOULD NOT NEED TO CHANGE, AND WOULD REMAIN AS RESIDENTIAL MEDIUM.
LASTLY, THE 4TH CATEGORY STAFF WANTED TO DISCUSS IS THE ZONING CODE TEXT AMENDMENT FOR THE ITR SITES.
THE GENERAL PLAN, LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION ELEMENT HAS AN ACTION STATEMENT WHICH IS TO UPDATE THE ZONING CODE TO INDICATE THAT ONCE AN ITR ZONE SITE HAS TRANSITIONED TO RESIDENTIAL USE, IT CANNOT BE RETURNED TO INDUSTRIAL USE.
AS A RESULT, STAFF IS PROPOSING TO AMEND THE ZONING CODE. SECTION 1926, 1, 2, 0.
CURRENTLY, THE ZONING CODE STATES THAT RESIDENTIAL USES SHALL BE ALLOWED IN ITR DISTRICT
STAFF RECOMMENDS ADDING LANGUAGE AS SHOWN HERE IN RED, TO ALIGN THE ZONING CODE WITH A GENERAL PLAN POLICY.
AS DESCRIBED IN THE STAFF REPORT FINDINGS. THE RECOMMENDED CHANGES ARE EXEMPT FROM THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT.
THE PLANNING COMMISSION DISCUSSED THIS ITEM AT A PUBLIC HEARING ON JANUARY 13, TH AND ONE MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC SPOKE IN SUPPORT OF THE PROJECT.
THE PLANNING COMMISSION VOTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION TO RECOMMEND APPROVAL OF ALTERNATIVE ONE BY A 6 0 VOTE WITH ONE MEMBER ABSENCE
TONIGHT. THE ALTERNATIVE TO CONSIDER WOULD BE ALTERNATIVE, ONE. TO ADOPT A RESOLUTION AND ORDINANCES RELATED TO THE GENERAL PLAN. LAND USE SPECIFIC PLANS, ZONING AND CODE AMENDMENTS AND FIND THAT THE ACTION IS EXEMPT FROM THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT.
THE SECOND ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE TO ADOPT THE ORDINANCES AND RESOLUTION WITH MODIFICATIONS.
AND THE 3RD ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE TO NOT ADOPT THE ORDINANCES AND RESOLUTION STAFF RECOMMENDS ALTERNATIVE. ONE.
GIVEN THAT THE FULL TEXT OF ALTERNATIVE ONE IS LENGTHY. THE COUNCIL MAY WISH TO MAKE THEIR MOTION BY USING THIS SIMPLIFIED TEXT AS SHOWN ON THE SCREEN THAT REFERS TO THE STAFF REPORT.
THIS CONCLUDES THE STAFF PRESENTATION STAFF IS AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COUNCIL? 1ST UP?
IS VICE MAYOR CELL?
HI, THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS WORK SO THAT WE CAN BE COMPLIANT WITH OUR HOUSING ELEMENT.
I HAD A QUESTION ABOUT THE ITRS.
SO WHEN WE TRANSITION THEM TO RESIDENTIAL THE BOTTOM FLOOR CAN'T BE RETAIL, OR
ANYTHING LIKE THAT. THAT WOULD BE NOT COMPLIANT WITH THE HOUSING ELEMENT.
BUT LET ME LET ME TRY TO ANSWER THAT FOR YOU. COUNCILMEMBER SAL. TRUDY RYAN, COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR. THE THE RESIDENTIAL ZONING ON THE PROPERTIES WOULD ONLY ALLOW THE RESIDENTIAL USES. THERE ARE SOME OTHER USES THAT ARE ALLOWED IN RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICTS, BUT WE ARE PROPOSING THE ZONING
TO
TO REGULARIZE, IF YOU WILL MAKE THE THE ZONING CONSISTENT WITH THE RESIDENTIAL LAND USE ON THE PROPERTIES THAT HAVE THE ITR ADDED TO THEM THAT WOULD ENABLE THE SITE TO CONTINUE TO BE USED AS AN INDUSTRIAL USE FOR THE RANGE OF USES THAT WOULD BE ALLOWED, OR AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE, TO CONVERT TO A RESIDENTIAL USE. BUT THERE'S NOT A MIXED USE COMPONENT TO THAT ZONING. SO IT'S 1 OR THE OTHER.
OKAY? SO I HAD JUST ONE LAST QUESTION ON ONE OF THE SITES ON DE GUINE AND STEWART. I THINK THERE'S A RESTAURANT THAT'S THE GAPE THERE.
AND SO ONCE WE DO THIS ZONING WITH THAT
RESTAURANT NOT ALLOWED TO BE THERE, WHAT THE ITR COMBINING DISTRICT DOES IS IT ALLOWS THE INDUSTRIAL OR IN THIS CASE COMMERCIAL USE ON THAT SITE TO STAY AS A LEGAL, CONFORMING USE. SO IT WOULDN'T BE CONSIDERED NONCONFORMING. WE'VE RETAINED THAT COMMERCIAL ZONING ON THE PROPERTY SO THEY COULD REMAIN. THEY COULD EXPAND
THEY CAN DO ANYTHING THAT'S WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF THE MS. INDUSTRIAL AND SERVICE ZONING DISTRICT. SO IT
UNLIKE
REZONING IT JUST TO RESIDENTIAL. THEN THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO THAT. SO THAT'S WHY THE ITR WAS CREATED WAS TO ALLOW THE CURRENT USES TO BE LEGALLY CONFORMING AND ON OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND. IF IF THAT WAS A BUSINESS NEED.
OKAY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU. VICE MAYOR. NEXT COUNCIL MEMBER MELLINGER.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. MAYOR. COULD WE GET FOIL 11? NO.
8.
SO
JUST TAKING A LOOK AT THE UPPER RIGHT QUADRANT THERE WITH WAVERLY, FLORENCE, AND CHARLES. THESE! WHAT ARE CURRENT? WHAT IS THE CURRENT USE OF THESE PROPERTIES? IS THIS MULTIFAMILY HOUSING ALREADY.
MOST OF THESE ARE SINGLE FAMILY OR 2 FAMILY DWELLINGS.
OKAY? AND SO THIS WOULD BE REZONED TO WHAT? ZONING DESIGNATION. AGAIN, R. 2
R. 2. SO THAT WOULD ESSENTIALLY ALLOW A SINGLE FAMILY OR DUPLEX. ASSUMING THE LOT. SIZE IS FAIRLY SMALL. RIGHT?
CORRECT. LET ME JUST ADD THAT THE R. 2 ZONING DISTRICT DOES ALLOW MULTIFAMILY. BUT YOU NEED SUFFICIENT LAND IN ORDER TO RIGHT. IT'S SOMETHING LIKE YOU GET ONE DWELLING UNIT PER 1,800 SQUARE FEET. IS THAT RIGHT? 3,600 IN THE R 2 ZONING DISTRICT. OKAY? ONE. TRY, THOUGH. YEAH, IT'S A FAIRLY LOW DENSITY USE. AND SO THAT'S ALREADY COMPATIBLE. THAT'S COMPATIBLE WITH WHAT'S ALREADY THERE. CORRECT? OKAY?
SO ESSENTIALLY, IF I'M UNDERSTANDING CORRECTLY, THE ONLY NET NEW HOUSING THAT WE ARE ADDING IS ON SLIDE 14.
IS THAT CORRECT?
WELL, WE'RE NOT CREATING ANY HOUSING, BUT WE ARE MAKING THE ZONING ON THOSE SITES CONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL PLAN DESIGNATION OF OF RESIDENTIAL. SO THAT'S THE ONLY CAPACITY THAT WE'RE ADDING. ESSENTIALLY, YEAH, IT CLARIFIES THE ZONING AND THE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS. A PROPERTY OWNER COULD SAY, WELL, YOU KNOW YOUR GENERAL PLAN ALREADY SAYS RESIDENTIAL, YEP.
OKAY. AND SO THE REST OF THIS IS SIMPLY BRINGING EXISTING USES INTO LINE WITH CURRENT ZONING, CORRECT
OR CURRENT ZONING INTO LINE WITH EXISTING USES. THAT'S CORRECT. OKAY, I ACTUALLY, CAN WE GET THAT SLIDE BACK? MR. CARNAHAN? SORRY.
SO
THE NEXT QUESTION I HAD IS ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS IN THIS AREA? THE WHOLE AREA ALONG STEWART. AND IS IT BEGUINE, HOW DO WE PRONOUNCE THAT
THE GUY, THE GYNE? IT'S THE GUY. OKAY,
THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL ISSUES WITH GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION IN THAT ENTIRE AREA. AND ACTUALLY, THERE'S ACTUALLY AN ARTICLE IN THE ATLANTIC ABOUT IT LIKE 1015 YEARS AGO. WHAT MITIGATION MEASURES ARE WE GOING TO BE REQUIRING TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF FUTURE RESIDENTS AT THESE LOCATIONS?
PAY OR TREAT?
OKAY? SURE.
HELLO, PRINCIPAL PLANNER KLEIN. SPEAKING FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. TO COME INTO THESE SITES, WE WOULD BE REVIEWING THE PROJECT BASED ON REGULATIONS THAT WOULD BE IN EFFECT, IN THE EITHER CURRENTLY OR IN THE FUTURE.
CONTAMINATED SITES ARE REGULATED BY EXTERNAL AGENCIES AS WELL. SO SUPERFUND SITES ARE REGULATED BY THE US. EPA.
AND SITES ARE CONTAMINATED, BUT DOESN'T RISE TO LEVEL OF BEING A SUPERFUND SITE OR REGULATED BY THE CALIFORNIA WATER BOARD.
SO WE WOULD BE WORKING THROUGH WITH THE APPLICANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE CLEARANCE LETTERS FROM THESE AGENCIES TO BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE TO THESE AGENCIES THAT THEY CAN MITIGATE IN WHATEVER METHOD THAT IS AVAILABLE AT THAT TIME
TO A LEVEL THAT IS ACCEPTABLE TO THESE AGENCIES FOR RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT, AND WE'VE ALREADY ADDED A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF HOUSING THROUGH THE IRVINE COMPANY AND OTHER DEVELOPERS IN THIS AREA, INCLUDING ADJACENT TO THESE SITES. SO WOULD IT BE FAIR TO SAY THAT THE CITY HAS SUBSTANTIAL EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH THE NECESSARY ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION. HERE WE HAVE WORKED WITH APPLICANTS. YES.
ALRIGHT. AND I GUESS THE LAST QUESTION I HAVE IS,
I I KNOW THAT WE'RE DOING THIS TO BRING THIS INTO THE ZONING INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE GENERAL PLAN, AND THE GENERAL PLAN, SAYS, MEDIUM DENSITY, WHICH WE DID AS PART OF OUR HOUSING ELEMENT. REMIND ME WHY WE DECIDED TO ZONE THIS SITE FOR MEDIUM DENSITY RATHER THAN SOME, OR PLAN THIS SITE FOR MEDIUM DENSITY RATHER THAN SOMETHING A BIT HIGHER.
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT? RATIONALE, MISS RYAN? I CAN. I CAN HELP YOU WITH THAT. SO
THE INITIAL IDEAS ABOUT ALLOWING RESIDENTIAL IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD STARTED IN THE MID 2 THOUSANDS, OR THE AUGHTS, IF YOU WILL, AND THE THERE WAS A COMBINATION OF OF R. 3 AND R. 4, MEDIUM AND HIGH DENSITIES THAT WERE EVALUATED. THERE WAS
ESSENTIALLY COMFORT FROM THE COUNCIL THAT THE R. 3 DENSITY WAS WHAT WAS APPROPRIATE, AND THAT WAS WHAT WAS COMMON AT THE TIME. WE WERE SEEING A LOT OF THAT TOWNHOUSE STYLE DEVELOPMENT. LOOKING AT THE IRVINE DEVELOPMENT THAT YOU MENTIONED. THEY HAVE A COMBINATION OF R. 4 AND R. 3 ZONING ON THEIR ON THEIR SITE. SO THE WHOLE. THIS AREA WE CALL EAST SUNNYVALE HAS A COMBINATION OF R. 3 AND R. 4.
AND SO IF WE, IF WE WERE OF AN APPETITE TO GO HIGHER DENSITY, THAT WOULD REQUIRE A GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT. MOST LIKELY. THAT IS CORRECT. OKAY, I DON'T HAVE ANY PARTICULAR APPETITE TO PROPOSE THAT THIS EVENING, IF ANY DEVELOPER IS WATCHING THIS AND LOOKING AT THAT SITE, I WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE OPPOSED TO SUCH A THING. BUT I'M NOT GOING TO KICK IT OFF MYSELF.
ALL RIGHT.
I THINK THAT DOES IT FOR MY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND APPRECIATE STAFF'S VERY HARD WORK ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER. NEXT UP IS COUNCIL MEMBER SRINI BASAN. THANK YOU, MAYOR. THANKS. STAFF FOR AN EXCELLENT PRESENTATION. THEN CAN WE BRING UP SLIDE 8, PLEASE?
SO ONE GENERAL QUESTION I HAVE. WHY DID WE MISS CERTAIN? THESE SEEM TO BE SOME POCKETS OF
DEVELOPMENT OR SITES WHICH WE MISSED. HOW DID WE MISS THIS, FOR EXAMPLE?
THE RIGHT BOTTOM, RIGHT. OXBOW COURT.
THAT'S A SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. AND WHY DID WE MISS THE ZONING ON THAT
AT ONE PERIOD IN SUNNYVALE'S HISTORY, RESIDENTIAL USES WERE ALLOWED IN ALL ZONING DISTRICTS.
AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT THE THEN COUNCIL ADOPTED TO ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE HOUSING IN THE COMMUNITY. SINCE THAT TIME THAT WAS MOVED BACK A LITTLE BIT, AND SOME AREAS WERE MARKED FOR NO RESIDENTIAL TO PRESERVE THEM FOR USES THAT WERE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH RESIDENTIAL USE. THIS PARTICULAR SITE, THE OXBOW THAT YOU MENTIONED IS ZONED OFFICE.
BUT BECAUSE RESIDENTIAL WAS PERMITTED. SO IT'S BEEN RESIDENTIAL SINCE IT WAS. YEAH, YOU KNOW, 40 YEARS AGO, PROBABLY
DEFINITELY MORE THAN 35 YEARS. I'LL TELL YOU THAT
I AGREE. I WALKED THROUGH THIS. THIS IS MY DISTRICT. SO HOW DID WE KNOW? HOW DID WE CORRECT? HOW DID WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO REZONE THIS? DID THE SOME RESIDENT ASK FOR IT? OR
WE JUST NOTICED THAT, OR HOW DID WE COME ACROSS THIS?
IT ACTUALLY STARTED WITH A RESIDENT ON THE ON PASTORIA. OKAY?
AND THEN FROM THAT RESIDENCE, PLEA, IF YOU WILL, TO COUNSEL A STUDY ISSUE IS CREATED.
AND THROUGH THE STUDY ISSUE WE MADE SOME AMENDMENTS TO THE ZONING CODE THAT WOULD ENABLE SOME SOME ACCESSORY LIVING UNITS ON THE PROPERTY ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS. SORRY WE CHANGED THE NAME A FEW YEARS AGO.
BUT THEN THE FOLLOW UP WAS, IF WE WANT TO
TO LOOK AT THAT SITE WE SHOULD LOOK AT ALL THE SITES. SO THESE WERE ALL THE SITES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED AS SINGLE FAMILY AND DUPLEX USES THAT WERE NOT ZONED FOR RESIDENTIAL USE. THANK YOU. THAT IS A GOOD EXPLANATION, SO CAN WE ASSUME THAT WE HAVE LOOKED COMPREHENSIVELY. AND THEN THERE COULD BE SOME SITES HERE AND THERE, BUT OVERALL
THE ZONING AND THE THE EXISTING BILLING UNITS ARE CORRECTLY ZONED. IS THAT CORRECT ASSESSMENT?
THIS IS DEFINITELY ALL OF THE SINGLE FAMILY AND DUPLEX. OKAY, THERE ARE A COUPLE OF OTHER ISOLATED SITES THAT DIDN'T MAKE SENSE, THAT WE STUDIED IN THE PREVIOUS ROUND, AND DID NOT
THINK THAT THEY WERE. IT WAS WORTH REZONING THEM BECAUSE OF OF THEIR OF THEIR CONTACT AND THEIR SURROUNDING. BUT WE'D HAVE TO GO BACK TO THAT THAT REPORT. BUT THIS WAS THE. THESE WERE THE SINGLE FAMILY AND DUPLEX SITES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED FOR
FOR REZONING. OKAY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THOSE ARE MY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER. NEXT UP IS COUNCIL MEMBER CHANG.
THANK YOU AND THANK YOU TO STAFF'S WORK ON THIS. I HAVE A QUESTION. SO FOR THE CONTAMINATED AND SUPERFUND SITES ON STEWART AND DEGYNE, IF THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO BE MITIGATED OR REACH A LEVEL OF SAFETY SUFFICIENT FOR RESIDENTIAL USE. HOW BIG OR HOW SIGNIFICANT OF AN IMPACT WOULD THAT BE ON OUR ON OUR HOUSING NUMBERS.
GENERALLY SPEAKING, WITH THE
LET ME BACK UP A LITTLE BIT. EVERY HOUSING ELEMENT CYCLE, WHICH IS ABOUT 8 YEARS. THE STATE ASSIGNS ALLOCATES TO CITIES A FAIR SHARE OF WHAT ARE REASONABLE HOUSING, ALLOCATION, NUMBERS. IF WE ARE WITHIN THIS 8 YEAR PERIOD, YOU KNOW, WE ARE MONITORING DEVELOPMENTS AS THEY COME THROUGH.
IF WE SEE THAT WE'RE NOT ABLE TO MEET THOSE NUMBERS, WE WOULD NEED TO IDENTIFY OTHER SITES, YOU KNOW, TO TRY TO MEET THOSE NUMBERS. SO THERE'S 2 PARTS OF THIS, YOU KNOW. ONE IS, YOU KNOW, AS WE'RE WORKING THROUGH ALL OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT POLICIES THAT WE'VE COMMITTED TO THE STATE TO DO. WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SITES THAT WE'RE ZONING FOR HOUSING, YOU KNOW, ARE GOING TO BE SAFE
FOR HOUSING USE. IF THESE SITES ARE NOT ABLE TO BE CLEANED UP, YOU KNOW, IF THE PROPERTY OWNERS ARE NOT NOT ABLE OR INTERESTED IN FINANCING IT, BECAUSE IT'S A LOT OF MONEY TO CLEAN UP.
AND WE'RE NOT. AND WE TRACK, YOU KNOW, OUR PERFORMANCE IN TERMS OF APPROVING HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. IF TOWARD THE END OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT CYCLE. IF WE'RE NOT ABLE TO MEET OUR TARGET NUMBERS, WE WOULD BE COMING BACK TO COUNCIL AND LOOKING AND PROPOSING, YOU KNOW, ALTERNATIVE SITES TO MEET THOSE NUMBERS. BUT YOU KNOW, FOR ASSURANCES, YOU KNOW, OUR IMMEDIATE PRIORITY IS TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS THAT WE BRING FORWARD TO COUNCIL ARE GOING TO BE SAFE.
AND THEN THE SECOND PART OF IS, YOU KNOW, INTERNALLY, YOU KNOW, WITH THE HOUSING DIVISION WE ARE TRACKING OUR PERFORMANCE IN TERMS OF MEETING OUR UNIT OBLIGATION.
AND LET ME JUST ALSO ADD TO THAT THAT THE SITES THAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT YOU REZONE OR THAT AREA, EVEN THE SITES THAT WE'RE NOT RECOMMENDING FOR REZONING RIGHT NOW ARE NOT SITES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED AS CONTRIBUTING TO MEETING OUR OUR REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION OR ARENA. SO THE IDEA WAS THAT THEY WOULD BE REZONED. SO FOR THE NEXT CYCLE THEY MIGHT BE AVAILABLE.
WE'VE IDENTIFIED MORE SITES THAN WE NEED TO TO MEET THAT RENA NUMBER OF ABOUT 12,000 UNITS. THE MAJORITY OF THOSE ARE IN THE MOFFETT PARK AREA, SO THESE NUMBERS ARE SMALL IN COMPARISON TO THE TOTAL OF 12,000 UNITS
TO THE OTHER ASPECT OF YOUR QUESTION. THANK YOU. AND I HAVE ONE MORE FOLLOW UP QUESTION. SO IF COUNCIL TAKES ACTION TONIGHT, YOU KNOW, HOW QUICKLY WOULD THAT GO INTO EFFECT? I KNOW FOR THE FOR THE RESIDENT ON PASTORIA. HE'S BEEN AT THIS FOR ABOUT 5 YEARS NOW.
SECOND SECOND READING IN 30 DAYS
A SECOND READING WOULD BE HEARD BY THE CITY COUNCIL, AND AFTER THAT IT WOULD BE EFFECTIVE WITHIN 30 DAYS.
SO THE SECOND READING WILL BE AT YOUR NEXT REGULAR COUNCIL MEETING, AND THEN 30 DAYS AFTER THAT, THE ORDINANCE IS EFFECTIVE. IF THAT PROPERTY OWNER HAS
SOME PLANS, THEY WANT TO SUBMIT. WE COULD ISSUE A BUILDING PERMIT THE THE DAY AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE.
SO WE WE COULD WORK WITH THEM ON THAT
HE MIGHT BE IN THE AUDIENCE.
THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER. NEXT UP IS COUNCIL MEMBER CISNEROS.
YES, THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU. COUNCIL MEMBER FOR ASKING THE QUESTION ABOUT THE PAST STORY AND HOW LONG IT TAKES. I'VE BEEN HEARING FROM THIS PERSON SINCE I GOT ON COUNCIL, AND I'M JUST REALLY GRATEFUL THAT I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY WHEN WE'RE ABLE TO SAY, HEY
TOOK CARE OF IT, AND I APPRECIATE STAFF FOR GOING AND AND TAKING THIS OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK THROUGH THE REST OF OUR CITY AND FIND THOSE PLACES WHERE WE MAY HAVE OTHER CLEANUPS. SO SO REALLY TAKING, LIKE, THEY HIGHLIGHTED AN ISSUE THAT
TURNS OUT IS KIND OF THROUGHOUT OUR CITY. SO THIS IS A REALLY GREAT STUDY ISSUE. WELL, FIRST, ST I HAVE TO SAY,
THAT 1993 HE DID. YOU KNOW THAT POLICY WAS INTENDED TO
ASSIST US IN THE JOBS HOUSING IMBALANCE. AND SO THAT'S JUST BEEN HERE FOR A REALLY LONG TIME. AND THAT JUST REMINDED ME OF HOW MANY YEARS OF CATCH UP. WE'RE TRYING TO PLAY AT ALL TIMES. SO IT MADE ME JUST APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT OUR STAFF AND THIS COUNCIL DOES, AND COUNCILS PAST AS WELL.
OKAY. SO FOR THE SITES ON IN EAST SUNNYVALE IS THE 30 ACRES REFERRING TO BE INCLUSIVE OF SITES, OR ONE THROUGH 3 OR ONE THROUGH 6.
SO IS IT LIKE THE 30.
LET ME TRY TO EXPLAIN.
LIKE THE 30 ACRES HERE IN EAST SUNNYVALE, ON SLIDE 14
WE HAD UP ON SLIDE 13. IT SAYS THERE'S A TOTAL. THE AREA TOTAL IS 30 ACRES. IS THAT THE ONE? IT WOULD INCLUDE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. IT WOULD INCLUDE SITES, ONE THROUGH 6, 1 THROUGH 6. OKAY? AND SO IN. AND I THINK THIS WAS KIND OF ASKED. BUT I'M JUST MAKING SURE. I UNDERSTAND THERE'S
CONTAMINATION IN THE OTHER SITES, AND SO THEREFORE WE'RE NOT INCLUDING IT. AND SO IF SOMEBODY DID, WE'RE NOT REZONING IT. BUT IF SOMEBODY WANTED TO GO AHEAD AND DO THAT CLEANUP THAT WE WOULD THEN RECONSIDER HERE. OKAY.
GOOD THAT. AND SO THAT'S JUST ON OUR RADAR. AND YOU KNOW.
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SEE THAT IN THE ZONING CODE, EITHER. SO SOMEBODY WOULD REALLY HAVE TO WANT TO GO AND DEVELOP BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T BE
RESIDENTIAL ZONING YET.
SO THEN, AND THE OTHER QUESTION I HAD WAS, YOU KNOW, I REALLY LIKE
THE LOOT ACTION STATEMENT THAT WE HAVE ON SLIDE 17 AND THEN 18. AND MY QUESTION, THERE, IS THERE ANY ANY OTHER ZONING REGULATIONS OR ACTION STATEMENTS THAT WE HAVE THAT RESTRICT THE CHANGING OF ONE LAND, USE DESIGNATION TO ANOTHER? OR IS THIS UNIQUE
IN THAT RESTRICTION.
I WOULD HAVE TO SAY, IT'S IT'S A FAIRLY UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCE, BECAUSE THE ITR
PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR 2 DIFFERENT USES OF THE PROPERTY. THE INTENT WAS THAT ONCE IT TRANSITIONS TO RESIDENTIAL, THEN THE THE INDUSTRIAL OR COMMERCIAL DESIGNATION WOULD NO LONGER BE NEEDED. BUT TO BE REALLY CLEAR, SO THAT YOU DON'T GET SOMEONE PROPOSING A USE THAT THEY SAY, WELL, IT'S YOU KNOW, AN MS. USE. IT HASN'T HAPPENED YET. WE JUST WANT TO KIND OF MAKE IT A LITTLE CLEANER TO MAKE THAT LESS OF A TEMPTATION FOR SOMEONE
THAT MAKES THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. AND WHY IT IS IT A UNIQUE POLICY IN THIS WAY, AND IT CAN'T BE. IT'S PRETTY UNIQUE. YEAH, OKAY?
ALL RIGHT. WELL, THAT'S THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING THERE. AND
I SAW HERE THAT ONE OF THE REZONE
FROM ITR TO RESIDENTIAL ENCAPSULATES A MOBILE HOME PARK.
AND THAT KIND OF STOOD OUT TO ME. AM I? AM I RIGHT?
LET ME LOOK AT THIS MAP?
NO, IT'S ACTUALLY SURROUNDED BY A MOBILE HOME PARK. YEAH, IT'S A LITTLE MINI STORAGE FACILITY ON FAIR OAKS. OH, OKAY, NEVER MIND. WE COULD REZONE IT, BUT WE THOUGHT.
IT'S AN ISOLATED SITE. IT'S PROVIDING A COMMUNITY SERVICE. AND WE CAN WAIT.
OKAY, THAT MAKES A LOT MORE SENSE THAN IT BEING THE ACTUAL MOBILE HOME PARK. SO I THINK THAT THEY THEY WOULD MIND. SO ANYWAY. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR REALLY HARD WORK, AND IN GETTING THIS TO US, AND I'M VERY EXCITED TO VOTE. YES.
THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER, THAT'S ALL OF COUNCIL QUESTIONS.
LET ME GO AHEAD AND OPEN THE PUBLIC PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS ITEM.
PLEASE SUBMIT A SPEAKER CARD OF THE CITY CLERK, RAISE YOUR DIGITAL HAND NOW, OR DIAL. STIR 9 IN YOUR TELEPHONE TO INDICATE THAT YOU WISH TO SPEAK. I WILL CALL ON MEMBERS OF PUBLIC PARTICIPATING IN PERSON, 1ST FOLLOWED BY REMOTE PARTICIPANTS. SPEAKERS WILL HAVE 3 MIN TO SPEAK.
I HAVE ONE SPEAKER, CARD, SIVA.
HI,
THIS IS A COMPLEX TOPIC, SO I DON'T HAVE ALL THE VERBS AND THE WORDS CORRECT. BUT LET ME TRY TO
GET TO THE POINT.
THE PROPERTIES AROUND THE CHARLES STREET
AROUND THIS BLOCK RIGHT HERE NEAR FLORENCE. WHEN YOU REZONE THEM.
THEN A BUILDER CAN PURCHASE ENTIRE LOT AND CAN PROBABLY CLAIM WHATEVER EXCEPTION THEY WANT TO, HOWEVER HIGH THEY WANT TO BUILD.
SO THINKING ALONG THOSE LINES, AND SO WHY INCREASE THE DENSITY? WHY NOT KEEP? IT
IS WHAT I'M GOING TO GET AT. IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE GOING TO PROCEED WITH THIS WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT ALL THE CONSEQUENCES THAT'S HAPPENING TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD. AND AND SO I WOULD.
MY, I THINK IT IS PROBABLY IN THE INTEREST TO KEEP IT AS IT IS, AND IF THEY ARE, IF WE ARE INTERESTED IN CHANGING THE ZONING.
PERHAPS, CONCERNING R. 0, AND BECAUSE THEY ARE SERVING SINGLE FAMILY HOMES TODAY.
WHAT? I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE REASON FOR INCREASING THE
ZONING FROM WHAT I'M READING HERE. IT SAYS THESE UNITS ARE GOING TO CHANGE FROM OFFICE TO LOW TO MEDIUM DENSITY. RESIDENTIAL.
WHY CHANGE IT? IT LOOKS LIKE IT OPENS UP DOORS FOR
VERY HIGH DENSITY. ALSO, IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO BUILD IT BECAUSE THEY CAN CLAIM BUILDERS REMEDY, THEY CAN CLAIM OTHER EXCEPTIONS, AND WHATEVER THEY WANT TO DO?
WHY OPEN UP THAT ADDITIONAL OPTIONS FOR FOR THAT AREA? IT ALREADY HAS SEEN A LOT OF DEVELOPMENT IN THERE. WHY DO YOU WANT TO OPEN THIS UP. I DON'T. I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
SO I NEED YOUR HELP TO HELP INTERPRET IT. I'M NOT A EXPERT IN UNDERSTANDING ALL THE RULES AND REGULATIONS READING THROUGH IT. PLEASE PLEASE HELP
ME INTERPRET IT, UNDERSTAND IT, AND KEEP THE NEIGHBORHOOD MORE SINGLE. FAMILY HOME FRIENDLY, THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY.
THANK YOU.
MR. MAYOR, I HAVE A QUESTION FOR STAFF ON THOSE COMMENTS. CAN YOU HOLD OFF UNTIL AFTER PUBLIC COMMENT? THANK YOU.
THAT WAS MY LAST SPEAKER CARD IN THE ROOM. CITY CLERK, DO WE HAVE ANY REMOTE PARTICIPANTS WISHING TO SPEAK ON THIS ITEM?
YES, MAYOR, 1ST IS WESLEY Y. FOLLOWED BY STEPHEN MEYER
WESLEY. YOU'VE BEEN UNMUTED, AND YOU HAVE 3 MIN TO ADDRESS THE CITY COUNCIL.
WESLEYYU: HELLO! MY NAME IS WESLEY. YOU I PROBABLY DON'T NEED TO REINTRODUCE MYSELF.
WESLEYYU: EXCUSE ME, THAT'S MY KIDS.
WESLEYYU: AND SHE'S JUST ON SPEAKER. SORRY ABOUT THAT. I PROBABLY DON'T NEED TO REINTRODUCE MYSELF, SINCE I'M PROBABLY THAT PROPERTY OWNER IN PASTORIA THAT WAS REFERENCED HERE EARLIER IN THIS MEETING. SO I'M SPEAKING TO SAY THAT I'M PLEASED THAT THE CITY LEADERS HAVE MADE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS ON THIS PARTICULAR STUDY ISSUE.
WESLEYYU: IT'S BEEN 5 YEARS IN THE MAKING, AND I'M IN FULL SUPPORT OF WHAT IS TO COME IN TERMS OF THE REZONING FROM MIXED INDUSTRY CORE TO OUR 0 IN THE PEARY PARK PACIFIC PLAN, AND TO ALLOW FOR THE LEGALITY OF
WESLEYYU: RESIDENTIAL USES IN THIS PERIOD. PARK SPECIFIC PLAN, SOMETHING. I NEVER REALLY UNDERSTOOD WHY IT WAS, YOU KNOW, RESTRICTED IN THE 1ST PLACE, AND I'M IN FULL SUPPORT OF THE GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT. REALLY, THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY. I'M PLEASED TO SEE THAT WE'VE MADE SOME PROGRESS. SO THANK YOU. THAT'S ALL.
THANK YOU.
NEXT UP IS STEPHEN M. FOLLOWED BY ALEX. D. STEPHEN. YOU'VE BEEN UNMUTED, AND YOU HAVE 3 MIN TO ADDRESS THE CITY COUNCIL.
STEPHEN MEIER: HELLO, CITY COUNCIL.
STEPHEN MEIER: THANKS AGAIN FOR YOUR ATTENTION TONIGHT.
STEPHEN MEIER: I JUST WANT TO REBUTTAL A PRIOR PUBLIC COMMENT REGARDING, WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? WELL, WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS. WE SEE UNHOUSED PEOPLE. WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE CANNOT AFFORD TO LIVE HERE, SO THE WHOLE PURPOSE AND INTENT OF THIS IS TO FIND OPPORTUNITIES FOR HOUSING.
STEPHEN MEIER: SO BY ALL MEANS, THESE SEEM LIKE GREAT OPPORTUNITIES. I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO ENCOURAGE
STEPHEN MEIER: EXTRA LEVEL OF REVIEW FOR THE SUPERFUND SITE.
STEPHEN MEIER: JUST DELEGATING TO OTHER AUTHORITIES, I THINK, IS INSUFFICIENT. SO THERE SHOULD BE SUNNYVALE PARTICIPATION.
STEPHEN MEIER: ACTIVELY REVIEWING ALL THAT GOES ON WITH REGARD TO THESE SITES. BUT BEYOND THAT GREAT JOB. LOVE THE HOUSING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
STEPHEN MEIER: I YIELD MY COMMENTS.
THANK YOU.
THE LAST SPEAKER IS ALEX. D. ALEX. YOU'VE BEEN UNMUTED, AND YOU HAVE 3 MIN TO ADDRESS THE CITY COUNCIL.
ALEX DEBONI: THANK YOU.
ALEX DEBONI: I JUST WANTED TO ALSO SAY THAT I LIVE ON ON NORTH AVENUE 2 BY WESLEY, AND I ALSO SUPPORT THE ZONING CHANGE. THANKS.
THANK YOU, MAYOR. THAT WAS THE FINAL REMOTE PUBLIC SPEAKER FOR THIS AGENDA ITEM. OKAY, I'LL GO AHEAD AND CLOSE PUBLIC HEARING
AND BRING IT BACK TO COUNCIL FOR ANY QUESTIONS. COUNCIL MEMBER MELLINGER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I WILL BE READY WITH A MOTION. BUT I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FIRST.ST REGARDING, AND IT LOOKS LIKE THERE MIGHT BE SOME OTHER QUESTIONS. SO I'LL COME BACK TO THE MOTION LATER. REGARDING THE REZONING AROUND CHARLES STREET, MS. RYAN. SO CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY WE ARE REZONING THESE LOCATIONS TO R. 2
THE R. 2 ZONING IS CONSISTENT WITH THE CURRENT USES OF THOSE PROPERTIES.
THE THE LOTS ARE SMALLER THAN A SINGLE FAMILY ZONING DISTRICT LOT.
THEY'RE ABOUT 5,000 SQUARE FEET, SO THAT'S SUFFICIENT LAND FOR AT LEAST ONE UNIT. A FEW OF THEM ARE
CLOSER TO 7,000, AND THEY HAVE THE 2 UNITS ON THEM. THEY'RE DUPLEXES TO THE POINT OF SOMEONE COULD ACQUIRE THE PROPERTIES AND BUILD AT A HIGHER DENSITY, THEY WOULD HAVE TO ACQUIRE QUITE A FEW OF THOSE PROPERTIES BEFORE THEY WOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT LAND TO EVEN CONTEMPLATE THAT. SO YOU WOULD HAVE QUITE A NUMBER OF PROPERTY OWNERS YOU'D HAVE TO DEAL WITH. BUT THE MAIN REASON IS TO MAKE THE ZONING MATCH THE CURRENT USE.
OKAY, SO THIS IS NOT INCREASING DENSITY ON THOSE SITES. NOW, JUST HYPOTHETICALLY, LET'S SAY A DEVELOPER DOES GO UP AND BUY, YOU KNOW. SAY, A BLOCK OF WORTH OF THOSE HOMES.
R. WHAT IS THE MAXIMUM HEIGHT UNDER R. 2.
SO OUR
I KNOW WHERE THE SPEAKER IS COMING FROM. THE THE HEIGHT LIMIT IS 30 FEET. SO THERE ARE 2 STORIES. HOWEVER, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF STATE LAWS WHEN YOU BUILD OVER A CERTAIN NUMBER OF UNITS AND HAVE A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THE UNITS AS AFFORDABLE.
THEN THAT ENABLES SOME WAIVERS AND CONCESSIONS FROM LOCAL REGULATIONS. BUT BUT LOT BY LOT, THAT WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO HAPPEN BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T HAVE
ENOUGH NUMBER OF UNITS OR PERCENT OF AFFORDABLE UNITS. RIGHT? SO THE WAY THE STATE DENSITY BONUS WORKS IS, IT IS BASED ON THE CURRENT ZONING.
AND SO YOU CAN GENERALLY ONLY GO SO FAR ABOVE THE EXISTING HEIGHTS AND ABOVE THE EXISTING DENSITIES, USING THE STATE DENSITY BONUS. IS THAT CORRECT.
NO, SADLY. THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF DISCRETION THAT THE DEVELOPER CAN REQUEST. AND IT WOULD BE UP TO THE CITY TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE WAIVER OR CONCESSION WASN'T NEEDED.
INTERESTING? OKAY? WELL.
THAT SAID THERE WOULD BE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF LOT ACQUISITION WORK THAT WOULD NEED TO BE DONE AT THESE LOCATIONS TO JUSTIFY ANY KIND, TO SUPPORT ANY KIND OF LARGER PROJECT, AND SO I WILL SAY THAT ON A MATTER OF GENERAL PRINCIPLE, IT IS GOOD TO ENSURE THAT OUR ZONING IS ALIGNED WITH OUR GENERAL PLAN, AND IT IS GOOD TO ENSURE THAT EXISTING LAND USES ARE ALIGNED WITH THEIR ZONING. I'VE SPOKEN TO MR. YOU, WHO CALLED IN
MANY TIMES ON THIS, AND YOU KNOW THE HOME THAT HE PURCHASED ON PASTORIA, WHICH IS WAS ABOUT 800 SQUARE FEET. I BELIEVE HE'S LARGELY BEEN UNABLE TO RENOVATE OR EXPAND THAT HOME DUE TO THE ZONING INCONSISTENCIES.
AND SO FOR THE OWNERS OF THOSE HOMES. IT POSES. THESE ZONING INCONSISTENCIES POSE VERY SERIOUS CHALLENGES TO THEM.
SO I'M GONNA TURN OFF MY MICROPHONE NOW, BECAUSE I SEE MY COLLEAGUES STILL HAVE QUESTIONS. BUT I'M GONNA LEAVE MY HAND UP FOR THE MOTION. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER. NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER LAY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH. I HAVE A JUST A GENERAL PROCESS QUESTION. MISS RYAN, I, THE COMMENTER, CALLED IN TO SAY THAT THIS WAS A 5 YEAR LONG PROCESS, AND I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT CAUSED THAT 5 YEAR LONG PROCESS.
THIS WAS ACTUALLY 2 STUDY ISSUES, AND THE I THINK IT WASN'T RANKED HIGH ENOUGH IN THE 1ST YEAR WHEN IT CAME CAME UP, AND THEN IT WAS RANKED THE FOLLOWING YEAR, SO THE 1ST STUDY WAS PROBABLY COMPLETED WITHIN A YEAR, AND THEN IT TOOK A WHILE TO GET STARTED ON THE SECOND STUDY ISSUE. SAME THING ABOUT WHERE IT WAS IN THE RANKING.
OH, OKAY, THANK YOU. I GUESS IT JUST SOUNDS LIKE, SO IT'S REALLY 2 STUDY ISSUES. OKAY.
THE WAY THAT IT SHOOK OUT LIKE THAT.
I GUESS I GUESS THIS IS A QUESTION FOR LATER. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU. NEXT UP IS VICE MAYOR SAL.
I THINK ONE OF THE COMMENTERS TALKED ABOUT SUPER FUND AND OVERSIGHT OF THAT.
AND SO IT SEEMS LIKE SUNNYVALE DOESN'T DIRECTLY TAKE A ROLE IN THE SUPERFUND CLEANUP OR WHATEVER. BUT IF IT'S THE WHATEVER BECOMES RESIDENTIAL NEEDS TO MEET A CERTAIN QUALITY FOR IT, FOR THE CITY TO COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT
THE CITY MAINTAINS SAFETY FOR RESIDENTIAL THERE'S OVERSIGHT BEFORE IT CAN. I THINK IT WAS DISCUSSED IN ONE OF THE QUESTIONS SAID MONDAY MORNING QUESTION, YEAH, THE CITY DOES TO MAKE SURE THAT RESIDENTIALS ARE SAFE.
THE THE PROGRAM FOR REVIEWING WHETHER IT CAN BE DEVELOPED AND THE MITIGATION MEASURES THAT ARE NEEDED
FOR THAT SAFETY ARE NOT DETERMINED BY THE CITY THAT'S NOT ASSIGNED TO THE CITY.
THAT IS ASSIGNED TO EITHER.
EPA. THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, WHICH IS A FEDERAL AGENCY WHEN IT'S A SUPERFUND SITE.
SOMETIMES THINGS MOVE FROM SUPERFUND TO A LESSER DEGREE, BUT THERE MIGHT STILL BE CONCERNS ABOUT SOIL OR VAPOR FROM SOIL OR GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION.
AND THEN IT MIGHT. IT'S LIKELY THE WATER. EXCUSE ME. THE REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARD, OR ON OCCASION FOR LESSER AMOUNTS OF CONTAMINATION THAT RESPONSIBILITY LIES WITH THE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT. THE CITY DOES NOT HAVE JURISDICTION OVER THAT.
SO I KNOW THIS SPEAKER ASKED US TO TAKE A STRONGER ROLE, BUT IT IS NOT ASSIGNED TO US TO DO THAT.
BUT BEFORE IT'S INHABITABLE OR BEFORE IT BECOMES RESIDENTIAL.
THERE NEEDS TO BE QUALIFICATIONS THAT THOSE THINGS WERE DONE BEFORE SUNNYVALE WOULD APPROVE, IT BEING RESIDENCES
CORRECT. WE HAVE THE EXAMPLE OF A PROPERTY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT ACTUALLY WAS DESIGNATED AS A SUPER FUND SITE.
AND ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THAT PARTICULAR SITE WAS DESIGNATED IS BECAUSE AT THE TIME IT WAS OWNED BY THE SAME PROPERTY OWNER OF AN ADJACENT SITE. THAT WAS A SUPERFUND SITE. SO IN AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION.
EPA INCLUDED BOTH THOSE PROPERTIES. SO THEN, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT IT DIDN'T HAVE THE SAME LEVEL OF CONTAMINATION, AND ULTIMATELY THE REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARD CAME UP WITH THE MITIGATION MEASURES. THERE WAS SOME SOIL REMOVAL. THERE WERE VAPOR BARRIERS THAT NEEDED TO BE INSTALLED AS PART OF THE CONSTRUCTION WHICH WE ASSURED HAPPENED
AS PART OF THAT THAT CONSTRUCTION. SO UNTIL THAT PROGRAM WAS SIGNED OFF BY THE REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARD. WE WE COULD NOT ISSUE PERMITS.
OKAY, THANK YOU. YEAH.
THANK YOU. VICE MAYOR, COUNCIL MEMBER MALLINGER.
MR. MAYOR, I AM READY WITH A MOTION JUST AS SOON AS WE COULD GET THE SLIDE WITH THE SUGGESTED MOTION. LANGUAGE UP, PLEASE.
ALL RIGHT. I MOVE ALTERNATIVE ONE, TO ADOPT THE RESOLUTION AND INTRODUCE ORDINANCES AMENDING THE GENERAL PLAN, SPECIFIC PLAN, ZONING MAP AND ZONING CODE AS SET FORTH IN ATTACHMENTS 2 TO 6 TO THE STAFF REPORT AND FIND THE PROPOSED ACTIONS EXEMPT FROM CEQA.
THANK YOU. COUNCIL MEMBER SRINIVASAN SELECTED TO YOUR MOTION.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. MAYOR. SO WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE TODAY IS 2 THINGS. WE ARE BRINGING OUR ZONING CODE INTO ACCORDANCE WITH OUR GENERAL PLAN FOR THE ITR ZONED AREAS. AND WE ARE IN AROUND AND WE ARE BRINGING OUR ZONING INTO LINE WITH EXISTING LAND USES THAT ARE LEGAL AND NONCONFORMING. I 1ST SPOKE ABOUT THIS MATTER WITH WESLEY. YOU WHO CALLED IN TONIGHT SEVERAL YEARS AGO.
AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM IS BECAUSE HIS PROPERTY WAS LEGAL, NONCONFORMING. HE COULD NOT EXPAND THE HOME THAT HE HAD PURCHASED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF HIS GROWING FAMILY.
AND THAT IS A FRANKLY, A VERY NASTY SURPRISE TO FIND OUT
IT IS BEST PRACTICES TO ENSURE TO MINIMIZE LEGAL NONCONFORMING USES IN ZONING. THIS WILL ENABLE THE OWNERS OF THESE PROPERTIES TO ESSENTIALLY ENJOY ALL THE RIGHTS AND BENEFITS OF ANY OTHER HOMEOWNER IN THE CITY.
AND
WHAT I SAID, WHEN I MADE THE MOTION A YEAR OR 2 A COUPLE YEARS AGO, TO PRIORITIZE THIS AS A STUDY ISSUE IS, THIS MAY NOT BE THE SINGLE, MOST IMPORTANT STUDY ISSUE FOR THE CITY, BUT FOR THOSE 27 PROPERTY OWNERS IT IS ABSOLUTELY THE MOST IMPORTANT STUDY ISSUE FOR THEM.
AND SO FIXING THIS.
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT FIX, AND IT ALSO HELPS KEEP US IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROMISES WE'VE MADE AS PART OF OUR HOUSING ELEMENT.
AND IT CLEARS THE STUDY ISSUE OFF THE DECKS FOR COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT, AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS MAKE ME VERY HAPPY. AND TO SUPPORT THIS, AND TO MAKE THIS MOTION, AND I RESPECTFULLY URGE MY COLLEAGUES. I VOTE. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
COUNCIL MEMBER SRINIVASAN. OH, OKAY, THANK YOU. YEAH.
I SEE NO OTHER COMMENTS. YES, I'M IN SUPPORT OF THIS MOTION. DEFINITELY, IN TALKING TO MULTIPLE OF THE PASTORIA RESIDENTS, THIS BRINGS THIS PROPERTY
INTO COMPLIANCE ON WHAT THE UNDERLYING USE IS ESPECIALLY SO THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO REINVEST IN THEIR HOMES, EXPAND THEIR HOMES, WHICH THEY WEREN'T COMPLETELY AWARE OF WHEN THEY 1ST PURCHASED THOSE PURCHASED, THOSE HOMES OF THAT UNDER UNDERLYING ZONING AND WHAT THE RESTRICTIONS THAT THAT WOULD CAUSE FROM A CITY CODE STANDPOINT.
I WANT TO THANK STAFF FOR, YOU KNOW.
GETTING 2 STUDY ISSUES REALLY ACROSS THE LINE HERE TONIGHT. AND
DEFINITELY, IT'S IT'S MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT. IT'S MAKING SURE THAT WE DEAL WITH THOSE LEGAL, NONCONFORMING SITES. IT'S MAKING SURE THAT THAT WE'RE INCLUDING
THE, YOU KNOW, BASICALLY RESPECTING THE UNDERLYING ZONING OF A LOT OF PROPERTIES WITHIN THE CITY. SO SO IT'S A IT WAS A GRAB BAG OF THINGS, AND I APPRECIATE YOU KNOW, THE COMPLEXITY HERE WAS IS QUITE A BIT, AND I UNDERSTAND IT'S TAKEN A WHILE TO GET THIS ACROSS THE LINE. THAT BEING SAID, YOU KNOW, I DO APPRECIATE
HAVING THIS.
LET'S SAY 1 1 BIG ITEM COME IN FRONT OF US. I THINK YOU KNOW, I UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE CONCERNS FROM THE RESIDENTS. THIS IS BASICALLY BRINGING THOSE PROPERTIES INTO LINE WITH THE CODE THAT'S ALREADY SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE FROM FROM THE OPERATION OF THOSE PROPERTIES RIGHT NOW. SO
AND THEN, AS FAR AS THE CONTAMINATED SITES. YOU KNOW, I WAS ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION WHEN WE APPROVED PREVIOUS SITES ALONG DEGWINE AND AND STEWART AND DUANE.
UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE, YOU KNOW, ONCE THE WATER BOARD DOES ITS EVALUATION, THERE ARE THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE. EITHER SOIL REMOVAL, EITHER THE VAPOR, THE VAPOR BARRIERS, TO MAKE SURE THAT THE HOUSING THAT IS CREATED IN THOSE AREAS IS SAFE FOR THE RESIDENTS, AND AND THAT'S, OF COURSE, AN IMPORTANT THING. WE WOULDN'T BE, YOU KNOW, PUTTING RESIDENTS AT RISK. AND SO THIS IS THIS IS
PART OF OUR ZONING, AND PART OF YOU KNOW THE WHOLE APPROVAL PROCESS WHEN WE'RE EVALUATING CEQA AT A SPECIFIC SITE. SO WITH THAT, I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE MOTION. SO THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER, MELLINGER.
AND CITY CLERK. CAN YOU PLEASE READ THE ORDINANCE TITLE AND CONDUCT THE VOTE?

MR. MAYOR, REQUEST A 5 MIN RECESS.

THANK YOU.
LET'S LET'S GO AHEAD AND RECONVENE AND MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT ITEM. ITEM 25, 0 1 0 1. RECEIVE AND FILE THE ANNUAL REVIEW OF NEW LAW. NEW LAWS REPORT AND APPROVE THE 2025 PRIORITY ADVOCACY ISSUES AND REVIEW LONG-TERM LEGISLATIVE ADVOCACY POSITIONS. IS THERE A STAFF REPORT.
YES, THERE IS MAYOR SARAH JOHNSON, ASSISTANT CITY MANAGER. I'M GOING TO DO A BRIEF KICKOFF THIS EVENING, AND THEN I WILL BE PASSING IT OFF TO MS. OR I. AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE TONIGHT IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN WE TYPICALLY DO THESE. AND SO WE HAVE 3 PARTS FOR YOU THIS EVENING. THE 1ST PART WILL BE TO
ACTUALLY INCORPORATE OUR ANNUAL REVIEW OF NEW LAWS INTO THE PUBLIC HEARING ITEM TONIGHT, AND WE WANTED TO JUST DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL NEW LAWS, OF COURSE, THAT ARE PASSED EVERY YEAR, MANY OF WHICH
HAVE IMPACTS ON ON CITY OPERATIONS. AND SO WE'VE INCLUDED THE ONES THAT HAVE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS FOR YOU THIS EVENING, SO THAT YOU CAN ASK ANY QUESTIONS IF YOU IF YOU HAVE ANY.
AND THEN, SECOND, AS USUAL, WE WILL PROVIDE A REVIEW OF RECOMMENDED CHANGES TO OUR 2025 PRIORITY ADVOCACY ISSUES AND TO OUR LONG TERM ADVOCACY POSITIONS, AND MICHELLE WILL GO OVER THOSE IN DETAIL THIS EVENING. AND 3, RD TONIGHT WE ARE EXCITED TO BE INTRODUCING OUR NEW FEDERAL AND STATE ADVOCACY TEAM.
AND WE WILL, AS PART OF THE PRESENTATION, HAVE OUR REPRESENTATIVE, NICCOLO DE LUCA, THE VICE PRESIDENT OF TOWNSEND. PUBLIC AFFAIRS MAKE AN INTRODUCTION, AS YOU'LL RECALL IN
WITH IN WITH COUNCIL DIRECTION IN THE ADOPTED BUDGET, WE PROCEEDED WITH DIRECTION TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT PROCESS, AND THAT WAS AN INTERDEPARTMENTAL PROCESS. AS ADVOCACY CROSSES SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS IN THE CITY, AND WE ARE VERY EXCITED TO BRING ON BOARD THE SAME TEAM TO REPRESENT THE CITY, BOTH AT THE STATE LEVEL AND THE FEDERAL LEVEL
FOR BOTH FUNDING AND LEGISLATIVE ADVOCACY EFFORTS. AND SO WE WILL BEGIN THE ONBOARDING PROCESS WITH THE TOWNSEND PUBLIC AFFAIRS TEAM, AND THEY WILL BE INVOLVED IN FUTURE LEGISLATIVE ITEMS, AND SO
EXCITED TO INTRODUCE THEM THIS EVENING. WITH THAT I WILL HAND IT OFF TO MICHELLE ZURAI, SENIOR MANAGEMENT ANALYST IN THE CITY MANAGER'S OFFICE.
THANK YOU, SARAH. CAN I HAVE THE PRESENTATION, PLEASE? THANK YOU, DAVID.
SO SARAH REVIEWED THIS SLIDE WITH YOU ABOUT THE OUTLINE ON THE AGENDA FOR TODAY, SO I'LL GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON.
SO THE ANNUAL REVIEW OF NEW LAWS REPORT, WHICH IS ATTACHMENT. ONE OF THE STAFF REPORT PROVIDES A SUMMARY BY DEPARTMENT OF THE SUBSET OF NEWLY PASSED LAWS THAT ARE ANTICIPATED TO HAVE THE MOST IMPACT TO THE CITY, INCLUDING SEVERAL OF THOSE IDENTIFIED ON THIS SLIDE. HERE THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES, PUBLISHED ITS ANNUAL LEGISLATIVE REPORT, WHICH IS ATTACHMENT 7 OF THE STAFF REPORT, AND IT SUMMARIZES THE LAWS PASSED IN THE 2024 CALENDAR YEAR AND INCLUDES AN ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON CITIES.
SO AS BACKGROUND, I'LL GO AHEAD AND DEFINE THE TERMINOLOGY USED IN THIS PRESENTATION AND FOUND IN THE STAFF REPORT. SO EVERY YEAR THE COUNCIL ADOPTS THE CITY'S ADVOCACY PLATFORM.
WHICH INCLUDES THE PRIORITY ADVOCACY ISSUES FOR THE YEAR AS WELL AS LONG TERM LEGISLATIVE ADVOCACY POSITIONS, OR WHAT WE CALL LEPS, FOUND IN EACH CHAPTER OF THE COUNCIL POLICY. MANUAL LEGISLATIVE ADVOCACY POSITIONS IDENTIFY THE CITY'S BROAD ADVOCACY POSITIONS ON ISSUES AND LEGISLATION THAT ARE SHORT TERM IN NATURE. PRIORITY ADVOCACY ISSUES ARE ISSUES WHERE LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITIES, EITHER
ALREADY UNDERWAY OR IMMINENT AND EXPECTED TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON CITY BUSINESS AND LONG TERM ADVOCACY POSITIONS OR LAPS ARE ONGOING POLICY POSITIONS. SO THIS REPORT PROVIDES COUNCIL WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE PROPOSED 2025 PRIORITY ADVOCACY ISSUES AND LONG TERM LAPS.
SO HERE'S A LOOK AT THE CITY'S LEGISLATIVE ADVOCACY PROCESS. SO THIS PROCESS ALLOWS THE CITY TO TAKE POSITIONS ON LEGISLATION RELATED TO STATED COUNCIL PRIORITIES, LEPS, EXISTING CITY POLICY DOCUMENTS AND MINIMIZES THE NEED FOR STAFF TO REQUEST DIRECTION FROM COUNCIL ON LEGISLATION ISSUES AS THEY ARISE.
SO 1ST COUNCIL IDENTIFIES PARTY ISSUES AND LEGISLATIVE ADVOCACY POSITIONS FOR THE YEAR WHICH WE'RE DOING TONIGHT.
STAFF TRACKS, LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS WITH POTENTIAL CITY IMPACTS AND COUNCIL PRIORITY ISSUES.
3 STAFF COORDINATES QUICK RESPONSES TO PENDING LEGISLATION BASED ON COUNCIL APPROVED POLICIES AND 4 STAFF PUBLISHES, CITY POSITIONS AND ADVOCACY LETTERS ON THE CITY'S LEGISLATIVE PARTIES, WEBPAGE
SO PRIORITY ADVOCACY ISSUES FOCUS ON REGIONAL STATE AND FEDERAL ACTIVITY ALREADY UNDERWAY OR EXPECTED WITHIN THE CALENDAR YEAR, AND WHERE THE PENDING LEGISLATION OR ISSUE IS EXPECTED TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON CITY BUSINESS PRIORITY AREAS MAY ALSO INCLUDE TIMELY ONGOING ADVOCACY ITEMS TO ENSURE ADEQUATE LEGISLATIVE ALIGNMENT OR FISCAL SUPPORT FOR LONGSTANDING CITY GOALS
THEREFORE, STAFF IS PROPOSING THESE 6, 2025, PRIORITY ADVOCACY ISSUES IDENTIFIED ON THIS SLIDE. AND THEY'RE ALSO AN ATTACHMENT TO THE STAFF REPORT FOR COUNCIL'S CONSIDERATION.
SO HERE IS A SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSED CHANGES TO PRIORITY. ADVOCACY ISSUES FROM 2024. STAFF PROPOSES UPDATING POLICY LANGUAGE IN 4 OF THE PRIORITY ADVOCACY ISSUES. THE RESULTING CHANGES ARE SUMMARIZED ON THIS SLIDE AND PROVIDED IN MORE DETAIL IN ATTACHMENT. 3 OF THE STAFF REPORT
HERE IS A SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSED DELETIONS TO OUR LONG TERM ADVOCACY POSITIONS, OR LAPS FOR THE PROPOSED DELETION AND COUNCIL POLICY. 7.0 F. 10 STAFF RECOMMENDS REMOVAL OF THIS POLICY POSITION, SINCE IT'S OUTDATED AND NO LONGER NEEDED.
AND FOR THE PROPOSED DELETION COUNCIL POLICY, 7.0 F. 11 STAFF RECOMMENDS REMOVAL OF THIS POLICY POSITION. SINCE A NEW MAP WAS ADOPTED ON MAY 1320 24, BY THE COUNTY COMMITTEE ON SCHOOL DISTRICT ORGANIZATION.
HERE IS A SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSED ADDITIONS TO OUR LAPS FOR THE PROPOSED ADDITION TO COUNCIL POLICY. 3.0 STAFF RECOMMENDS ADDING THIS NEW POLICY, POSITION PER COUNCIL DIRECTION AT THE MAY 21, ST 2024 COUNCIL MEETING.
AND FOR THE PROPOSED ADDITION TO COUNCIL POLICY, 7.0 STAFF RECOMMENDS ADDING THIS NEW POLICY POSITION TO REFERENCE COUNCIL'S ACTION AT THE JANUARY 14, TH 2025 COUNCIL MEETING.
SO TONIGHT STAFF IS RECOMMENDING THAT COUNCIL RECEIVE AND FILE THE ANNUAL REVIEW OF NEW LAWS REPORT REVIEW, EXISTING PRIORITY ADVOCACY ISSUES AND LAPS. CONSIDER STAFF'S RECOMMENDATIONS AND PROVIDE OTHER DIRECTION ON CHANGES TO PRIORITY ADVOCACY ISSUES AND OR LAPS. NOW, I'M PLEASED TO HAND IT OVER TO NICOLA DE LUCA, VICE PRESIDENT OF TOWNSEND. PUBLIC AFFAIRS TO INDUCE. INTRODUCE TOWNSEND.
THANK YOU, HONORABLE MAYOR, MADAM VICE MAYOR, COUNCIL MEMBERS, AND CITY MANAGER AND STAFF. MY NAME IS NICOLO DE LUCA. I'M A VICE PRESIDENT TOWNSEND PUBLIC AFFAIRS. I'VE BEEN AT THE FIRM FOR 17 YEARS, AND I WORK OUT OF OUR SACRAMENTO OFFICE
BEFORE THAT I WORKED AT A LARGE CITY IN THE BAY AREA, AS IN MY LAST POST, WAS DEPUTY CITY ADMINISTRATOR. SO I'M REALLY PROUD OF MY CAREER IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT. I WILL BE VERY FAST, BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'VE GOT YOU'VE HAD A LONG COUNCIL MEETING, SO JUST BRIEFLY ABOUT US. WE WERE FOUNDED IN 1998 BY CHRISTOPHER TOWNSEND.
OUR FOCUS, REALLY TO HELP IMPROVE COMMUNITIES.
MAJORITY OF OUR CLIENTS ARE PUBLIC ENTITIES, PRIMARILY CITIES. AND THEN WE'RE REALLY, REALLY PROUD THAT WE'VE HELPED OUR CLIENTS SECURE OVER 3.2 BILLION IN PROJECT FUNDING. THAT'S NOT FORMULAIC. THAT'S ACTUALLY FUNDING THAT WE GO AND WORK ON. AND THEN WE'VE HAD OVER 150 CLIENT BILLS SIGNED INTO LAW.
SO YOU'RE THINKING, OKAY, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO FOR THE CITY OF SUNNYVALE? AS THE ASSISTANT CITY MANAGER SAID. WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED ON 3 MAIN TOPICS, AS YOU WILL SEE, STATE LEGISLATIVE ADVOCACY.
FEDERAL LEGISLATIVE ADVOCACY. AND CERTAINLY TODAY'S BEEN A VERY BUSY DAY ON THE FEDERAL SIDE, AND THEN GRANT WRITING AND FUNDING ADVOCACY.
THE NEXT SLIDE IS KIND OF WHAT OUR ADVANTAGE IS. YOU WILL SEE THE ATTENTION OF A SMALL FIRM THE STRENGTH OF A LARGE FIRM, AND THEN THE COMMITMENT OF THE SENIOR TEAM.
I DO WANT TO SAY, YOU SEE ME SPEAKING. TODAY, WE HAVE AN AMAZING TEAM BEHIND US. WE HAVE A FULL OFFICE IN DC. IN SACRAMENTO AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, AND AT THE END OF ONE OF THESE SLIDES YOU'LL SEE SOME OF THE OTHER TEAM MEMBERS THAT WILL BE PART OF THE TEAM FOR SUNNYVALE.
NEXT SLIDE. ALL RIGHT. STATE ISSUES IN 2025.
THE STATE! THE NEW YEAR'S REALLY KIND OF KICKED OFF.
UNFORTUNATELY, THE FIRES IN LOS ANGELES HAVE REALLY TAKEN A LOT OF ATTENTION AS TO WHAT HAS BEEN GOING ON. SOME OF THE TOPICS THAT WE KNOW WILL BE COMING WILL BE LEGISLATION ON HOUSING THE CAP AND TRADE REAUTHORIZATION, INSURANCE FOR HOUSES AND FIRE AREAS AND JUST INSURANCE IN GENERAL.
THERE'S BEEN AN ISSUE LATELY ABOUT PUBLIC MURALS AND AND PUBLIC ART THAT LEGISLATION IS COMING.
REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION MEASURE FOR THE 9 BAY AREA COUNTIES. AND THEN, OF COURSE, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROPOSITIONS APPROVED IN NOVEMBER.
JUST VERY QUICKLY, AND I KNOW WE'LL BE DOING A DEEPER DIVE IN THE ONBOARDING TOMORROW JUST TO HIGHLIGHT. FEBRUARY 21ST IS THE LAST DAY FOR BILLS TO BE INTRODUCED. AS WE GET CLOSER TO THAT DATE THERE WILL BE MORE BILLS INTRODUCED. THE FRIENDLY WAGER WE HAVE AMONGST MY COLLEAGUES IN OUR SACRAMENTO OFFICE IS AROUND 3,200 BILLS TO BE INTRODUCED THIS SESSION.
AND THEN QUICKLY ON THE FEDERAL SIDE.
OBVIOUSLY WITH 119TH CONGRESS, NEW LEADERSHIP AND ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGES.
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE PENDING APPROPRIATION REQUESTS FROM LAST FISCAL YEAR. WE'LL HAVE A BETTER SENSE IN MARCH, AND THEN, OF COURSE, FISCAL FEDERAL EARMARK REQUESTS FOR FISCAL YEAR 26
AND THEN AGAIN, THIS IS OUR TEAM.
YOU WILL SEE ELISA IS GOING TO BE PART OF THE SACRAMENTO TEAM. BEN AND JOSEPH, PART OF THE DC. TEAM, ALEX AND BARBARA, PART OF THE GRANTS TEAM. WE ARE REALLY PROUD OF OUR TEAM APPROACH. I'M REALLY PROUD OF THE TEAMMATES I GET TO WORK WITH. THEY MAKE IT A PLEASURE TO COME TO WORK EVERY DAY.
AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU ALL MAY HAVE. AND AGAIN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE CONFIDENCE IN OUR TEAM AND LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE CITY OF SUNNYVALE AND EVERYONE. SO THANK YOU.
WITH THAT, WE'RE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS, AND WE HAVE A NUMBER OF STAFF ONLINE WHO ARE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS AS WELL.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
ARE THERE QUESTIONS FROM COUNCIL 1ST UP? IS COUNCIL MEMBER SRINIPASAN.
I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THOMPSON.
IN ONE OF THE SLIDES YOU MENTIONED.
SMALL TEAM. SMALL FIRM. HOW BIG IS YOUR FIRM? WE HAVE 19
IN OUR FIRM. AND I WANT TO SAY, 14 OF US ARE BOTH REGISTERED STATE AND FEDERAL ADVOCATES. OKAY, HOW MANY ON THE GRANTS WRITING TEAM? THE GRANTS TEAM IS 5,
AND THE GRANTS MANAGER IS ALEX GIBBS. HE'S BEEN WITH US FOR ABOUT 13 YEARS.
AND THEN BARBARA IS PART OF OUR TEAM. SHE'S A SENIOR ASSOCIATE. SHE'S ALSO GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THE SUNNYVALE WORK. THAT'S NOT TO SAY OTHERS WON'T BE HELPING. BUT THOSE ARE THE 2 PRIMARY CONTACTS.
SO ARE THEY FAMILIAR WITH STATE AND FEDERAL GRANTS? OR HOW DOES THAT WORK? ABSOLUTELY? OUR TEAM IS VERY WELL VERSED IN FEDERAL FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES, STATE FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES, AND ALSO REGIONAL FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES. SO WE KNOW THAT OVER THE YEARS THERE'S BEEN A GREATER REGIONAL FOCUS, WHETHER IT'S COUNTY FUNDING OR THINGS OF THAT NATURE ARE REALLY PROUD OF OUR TRACK RECORD.
THE 3.2 BILLION THAT WE TALKED ABOUT THAT IS SINCE 1998. AND THOSE ARE GRANTS AND FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES. WE WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR CLIENTS TO HELP SECURE AS PART OF A TEAM EFFORT.
THANK YOU. THAT WAS MY NEXT QUESTION OF THAT. ANY ROUGH SPLIT DOWN FEDERAL STATE AND REGIONAL MIX ABSOLUTELY AND SOMETHING ELSE. AND THERE'S NOT JUST IT'S OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE THE TRADITIONAL FUNDING GRANT OPPORTUNITIES, SOMETHING THAT WE'VE HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS OVER LIKE I'D SAY AT LEAST THE LAST 10 TO 15 YEARS ARE THE FEDERAL AND STATE EARMARK REQUESTS, WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING WITH THE CITY ON ON THOSE ASKS.
OKAY, THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THOSE ARE MY QUESTIONS FOR NOW. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER. NEXT UP IS COUNCILMEMBER. MILLINGER.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. MAYOR. IF COUNCIL IS OF A MIND, ADD LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. I I'M JUST GOING TO ASK STAFF. MRS. I IMAGINE THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS TO DIRECT STAFF TO COME BACK WITH DRAFT LANGUAGE RATHER THAN TO TRY TO WORDSMITH SOMETHING FROM THE DAIS.
LOOKING AT MY CITY ATTORNEY HERE ON WHAT HER RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE.
YES, I THINK THAT'S THE BEST APPROACH. GREAT THANK YOU. THAT IS
ONE OF MY QUESTIONS. THE REMOVAL FOR 7 0. F. 11, THE REDISTRICTING STANCE. I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THAT ONE, BECAUSE THERE WILL BE ANOTHER REDISTRICTING PROCESS IN 2030,
RIGHT, OR RATHER 2031
AND FOR NOT JUST FREMONT UNION, BUT FOR SUNNYVALE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND ALL THE OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT COVER SUNNYVALE.
WOULD IT BE PROBLEMATIC TO ESSENTIALLY LEAVE THAT ONE DORMANT AND JUST HAVE A
POLICY, YOU KNOW, A LONG TERM PRIORITY ON THE BOOKS THAT WILL ADVOCATE FOR COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST AS PART OF REDISTRICTING PROCESSES.
COUNCILMAN. EXCUSE ME, COUNCILMAN, IF YOU'D LIKE TO. COUNCIL WISHES TO LEAVE IT ON. WE CAN. IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE TO REPHRASE IT. SO WHATEVER COUNCIL WISHES.
OKAY,
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I HAVE, DO WE CURRENTLY HAVE A PRIORITY TO ADVOCATE FOR REGIONAL FUNDING MEASURES OF STATE AND REGIONAL FUNDING MEASURES FOR TRANSPORTATION AND HOUSING.
I DON'T THINK WE BUT I COULD BE WRONG.
SO COUNCILMAN MELLINGER, THE PRIORITY ADVOCACY ISSUES ARE LISTED FOR TONIGHT'S CONSIDERATION. THERE'S THERE'S OTHER PLACES WHERE WE COULD HAVE POLICY, FOR INSTANCE, IN THE GENERAL PLAN. SO THERE'S OTHER POLICY DOCUMENTS.
IF COUNCIL CHOOSES, STAFF CAN WORK ON DEVELOPING LANGUAGE TO COME BACK WITH.
SO I WANT TO SIGNAL. AND THIS YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS IN MY REPORT ON INTERGOVERNMENTAL ACTIVITIES LATER TONIGHT. BUT CALTRAIN IS CURRENTLY FACING A 75 MILLION DOLLARS ANNUAL STRUCTURAL DEFICIT, ROUGHLY. AND YOU KNOW, THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT A REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION FUNDING MEASURE WHICH MIGHT BE BROAD AND APPLY TO MANY AGENCIES, OR MIGHT BE A CALTRAIN SPECIFIC MEASURE.
CALTRAIN IS A VITAL TRANSIT LINK FOR THIS CITY, AND A VITAL RESOURCE FOR THIS CITY. AND SO, YOU KNOW, POSSIBLY HAVING SOME KIND OF POSITION ADVOCATING FOR A REGIONAL TRANSIT FUNDING MEASURE IS SOMETHING THAT I MIGHT HAVE SOME APPETITE TO ASK STAFF TO COME BACK WITH.
I'M GONNA TURN OFF MY MICROPHONE FOR NOW AND SAVE MOST SAVE WHAT THE REST OF WHAT I HAVE FOR AFTER PUBLIC COMMENT. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER. NEXT UP IS VICE MAYOR CELL.
HI! THIS IS THESE QUESTIONS ARE FOR TOWNSEND.
SO WENT TO THANK YOU FOR COMING ON BOARD AND HELPING OUR CITY. IT'S CHALLENGING TIMES COMING UP FOR THE STATE IN TERMS FISCALLY, BECAUSE WE HAD THE, YOU KNOW, CALIFORNIA SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FIRES, AND THEN AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL.
MORE CONSTRAINTS ON FUNDING. SO WHERE DO YOU SEE? AS A PATH FORWARD. GIVEN THOSE 2 THINGS.
OF COURSE. SUNNYVALE, TOO.
IS THAT SOMETHING WE'LL TALK ABOUT TOMORROW, OR IS IT GENERAL LIKE STRATEGY LIKE?
IS THERE ANY RAY OF HOPE? ABSOLUTELY
THROUGH THE MAYOR TO THE VICE MAYOR. 1ST OF ALL, YOUR 1ST STEP IS RIGHT NOW BY ENGAGING ADVOCACY FIRM. WE'RE IN DC. WE'RE IN SACRAMENTO
TODAY, I DON'T THINK WAS ONE OF THE BEST DAYS IN NEWS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ABOUT PAUSING THE FUNDING WHICH IS NOW PUT ON HOLD BY A JUDGE.
WE'VE BEEN EXPECTING THAT. I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF RAYS OF HOPE. THERE'S STILL A LOT OF FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES OUT THERE FOR COMPETITIVE GRANTS
KEEP IN MIND ON THE STATE SIDE. IN NOVEMBER PROPOSITION 5 WAS VOTED INTO WAS APPROVED BY THE PUBLIC. THAT WAS A CLIMATE BOND. IT'S 10 BILLION DOLLARS. THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES THERE.
THERE HAS BEEN A SPECIAL SESSION IN SACRAMENTO TO ADDRESS THE FIRES IN LOS ANGELES. I THINK I WANT TO SAY IT'S 1.5 BILLION THAT THE STATE HAS ALLOCATED. A LOT OF THAT IS ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT IT'S GOING TO BE BACKFILLED FROM THE FEMA DECLARATION. SO I WOULD SAY AT TIMES SOME OF THE HEADLINES AND THE QUICK NEWS HITS AREN'T THE MOST POSITIVE.
HOWEVER, THERE'S STILL A LOT OF FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES OUT THERE ON THE STATE SIDE, ON THE FEDERAL SIDE, INITIALLY BEFORE THE FIRES. THE GOVERNOR WAS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT A POTENTIAL SURPLUS WHICH IS ALWAYS GREAT NEWS. LAST YEAR WAS A HARD BUDGET YEAR FOR THE STATE, BECAUSE THEY HAD TO KIND OF GET THEIR HOUSE IN ORDER. WE'LL SEE HOW THINGS SHAPE OUT. WE'LL HAVE A BETTER SENSE IN APRIL AND MAY.
BUT WE'RE ALWAYS OPTIMISTIC, AND WE'RE ALWAYS FIGHTING. AND I THINK THE MORE FREQUENT THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER, HAVE A STRONG LEDGE PLATFORM WHICH WILL GO INTO GREATER DETAIL TOMORROW. I AM CONFIDENT THERE'LL BE SOME GOOD OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE COULD WORK ON AND FIGHT FOR.
OKAY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU'RE VERY WELCOME. AND I WANTED TO ASK
STAFF ABOUT IN THE MONDAY MORNING QUESTIONS. THERE WAS A LIST OF ITEMS THAT WERE SUGGESTED TO BE ADDED, AND I THOUGHT.
MANY OF THOSE ITEMS SEEM VERY USEFUL, AND THEN STAFF PROVIDED LIKE WAYS IN WHICH THEY MIGHT BE IMPLEMENTED LIKE
GIVEN LIKE. SOME OF THESE ITEMS ARE VERY RELEVANT WHEN I READ THEM, AND THEN STAFF PROVIDED A DIRECTION WHERE THEY MIGHT GO FORWARD.
HOW WOULD HOW WOULD YOU SUGGEST? THERE'S LIKE MANY THINGS THAT ARE THERE? HOW WOULD YOU SUGGEST WE LIKE MOVE FORWARD. THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION.
ANY SUGGESTIONS?
STAFF.
MICHELLE, YEAH. SO, VICE MAYOR, SELL TONIGHT IS COUNCIL'S OPPORTUNITY. IF THEY WANTED TO DISCUSS ADDING A SPECIFIC POLICY POSITION, THIS WOULD BE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR COUNCIL TO DISCUSS THAT, AND STAFF WOULD COME BACK WITH SOME PROPOSED LANGUAGE, IF NOT THE POLICY CITATIONS KIND OF DEPENDING ON WHEN THE LEGISLATION COMES, OR FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES COME, IF
IF THERE NEEDS TO BE A DECISION ABOUT POLICY, YOU KNOW.
CONSULTING WITH THE CITY MANAGER, THE MAYOR, TO SEE IF WE HAVE A PAUSE. POSITION IN PLACE, IF NOT, STAFF COULD COME BACK TO COUNCIL AT THAT TIME FOR
DIRECTION. SO REALLY UP TO THE COUNCIL, AND IF THEY WANT STAFF TO MOVE FORWARD WITH SPECIFIC LANGUAGE TONIGHT, OR IF THEY ARE COMFORTABLE IN WHAT WE HAVE AND COME BACK AS NEEDED.
OKAY, SO ONE LAST THING. SO YOUR ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION WAS MAINLY.
IT'S ALL THERE, LIKE ALL THOSE BULLETS ARE ADDRESSED IN THESE DOCUMENTS THAT ALREADY EXIST.
IS THAT KIND OF THE POINT OF THE ANSWER STAFF'S ANSWER TO THE QUESTION, BASED ON THE THE QUESTION. YOU KNOW, WITHOUT A LOT OF DETAIL ON WHAT THE SPECIFIC WOULD BE WE DO HAVE A LOT OF
DIFFERENT POLICIES FOR THE HOUSING AND THE TRANSPORTATION. SPECIFICALLY, IN CONSULTATION WITH OUR COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR, PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR, WE HAVE A LOT OF REGIONAL COUNTY AND LOCAL POLICIES MORE SO THAN AT THE FEDERAL. SPECIFICALLY. SO, THAT WAS THE RESPONSE THERE. BUT AGAIN, WITHOUT DOING THE SPECIFICS OF THE LEGISLATION, OR WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO.
YOU KNOW, JUST GOING BASED ON THE QUESTION THAT WAS RECEIVED. OKAY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR THOROUGHNESS. AND I REALLY LIKE HOW THE POLICIES WERE WRITTEN TO HAVE BULLETS AND
CLEAR STATEMENTS, WHICH WAS A REVISION FROM LAST YEAR. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR EXCELLENT WORK. YOU'RE WELCOME.
THANK YOU. VICE MAYOR. NEXT UP IS COUNCIL MEMBER CHANG.
THANKS FOR THE PRESENTATION AND FOR TOWNSEND FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT. THIS QUESTION IS MORE, FOR NICOLO COULD. SORRY. NO, NO PROBLEM. COULD YOU ELABORATE A LITTLE MORE ON WHAT IT WOULD MEAN IF THE TEMPORARY BAN ON A TEMPORARY BLOCK ON THE FREEZE DOESN'T LAST, AND WHAT THAT COULD MEAN ON THE CITY. ABSOLUTELY SO THROUGH THE MAYOR. SO
WE, IF YOU USE THE 1ST
4 YEARS OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, WE SAW A PATTERN OF
THINGS BEING QUICKLY PROPOSED, AND THEN BEING SHOT DOWN, WHETHER BEING UNCONSTITUTIONAL OR CONGRESS GOT INVOLVED, OR WHAT HAVE YOU
SO A LOT OF WHAT WAS PROPOSED LAST NIGHT WAS A TEMPORARY PAUSE FOR ALL THE DIFFERENT FEDERAL AGENCIES TO LOOK AT SOME OF THEIR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, AND REPORT BACK BY THE 10TH
SOME OF THE FEEDBACK. AND I'M REALLY PROUD OF OUR TEAM IN DC, BECAUSE THEY'RE HUSTLING ALL DAY TODAY. A LOT OF THE FEEDBACK THAT WE GOT WAS FROM DIFFERENT
MEMBERS, NOT JUST CALIFORNIA MEMBERS, BUT MEMBERS THROUGHOUT THE US. OF BOTH PARTIES, SAYING.
WE'RE CONGRESS. WE APPROPRIATED THIS MONEY. NOW IT'S TIME TO SPEND THE MONEY. SO THERE IS DEFINITELY A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE MEMO THAT SAID PAUSE, EVERYTHING. AND THEN WHAT'S HAPPENING? IN ADDITION TO SOME OF THE NONPROFITS THAT FILED THE LAWSUIT. I THINK, AS A LAST COUNT, 29, STATE ATTORNEY GENERALS ALSO FILED A LAWSUIT, SAYING, THIS IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
SO, WITHOUT HAVING A CRYSTAL BALL WE DON'T FEEL.
AND THERE'S A LOT OF WAYS TO PREVENT JUST A COMPLETE STOP OF FUNDS FLOWING, WHETHER TO CALIFORNIA OR ANY OTHER STATE.
SO THAT WAS THE 1ST MOVE. NOW IT'S WHAT COMES NEXT. AND THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSIONS ABOUT SANCTUARY CITIES, AND WHAT HAVE YOU SO TO KIND OF IN A LONG, WINDED WAY TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION.
WE DON'T SEE A PREDICAMENT WHERE ALL OF A SUDDEN FEDERAL FUNDING TO CALIFORNIA JUST STOPS. IN ADDITION, OUR GOVERNOR AND STATE LEGISLATURE HAVE ALREADY MADE IT CLEAR THAT THEY'RE GOING TO FIGHT THIS TOOTH AND NAIL, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, BECAUSE THE FUNDING'S NEEDED THROUGHOUT.
I THINK WHERE WE NEED TO BE MORE STRATEGIC WOULD BE ON THEN SOME OF THE FEDERAL FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES AND REALLY MAKING SURE WE'RE PICKING THE RIGHT GRANTS TO GO AFTER. AND WE'RE WORKING AT ON WITH OUR DELEGATION IN DC. ON SOME REALLY STRONG FEDERAL EARMARKED PROJECTS TO MAKE SURE THOSE ARE NICE AND TIGHT THAT'S ON THE FEDERAL SIDE. AND THEN, AS I MENTIONED EARLIER, ON THE STATE SIDE, THERE'S ALSO AN ABUNDANCE OF FUNDING COMING THROUGH THE DIFFERENT BONDS AND SOME OF THE EXISTING PROGRAMS.
THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER. I HAD SEVERAL QUESTIONS.
FIRST, ST AND AND A LOT OF THIS GOES BACK. AND SO THANK YOU FOR THE MONDAY MORNING QUESTIONS. YOU KNOW, VICE MAYOR, THAT WAS, OR THE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS. THAT WAS MY KIND OF LAUNDRY LIST OF TRYING TO CAPTURE
ISSUES AS THEY'RE RELATING TO TO SOME DEGREE
LONG-TERM ADVOCACY POSITIONS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE.
AND I'LL START WITH. SO AS THESE ARE CURRENTLY LISTED OUT HERE.
DO YOU SUGGEST? AND AND THIS IS A QUESTION OF, LET'S SAY, DETAIL ORIENTED OR MORE GENERAL. SO SO, LOOKING AT KIND OF THE DIFFERENT AREAS THAT I LISTED HERE.
DO YOU CONSIDER IT WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE FROM LONG TERM ADVOCACY, POLICY, POSITION SEVENATO
FOR EACH OF THESE 5 OR 6 THAT I LISTED ARE THEY COVERED, YOU KNOW. AND THIS IS A THIS IS A QUESTION OF SHOULD WE ADD ADDITIONAL WORDING, IN YOUR, IN STAFF'S OPINION, TO NARROW DOWN THIS SCOPE?
OR IS IT GENERAL ENOUGH THAT IT GIVES STAFF FLEXIBILITY. THE MAYOR FLEXIBILITY COUNCIL TO PUT IN THOSE REQUESTS TO STAFF
TO ADVOCATE ON AN EVER CHANGING LIST OF OF STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS AND AND LAWS COMING THROUGH. YES, THANK YOU, MAYOR. I CAN ALSO DEFER TO THE CITY MANAGER IF HE HAS THOUGHTS ABOUT THIS. BUT AS STAFF GOES THROUGH.
YOU KNOW, REQUESTS FOR ADVOCACY, FUNDING THE MORE GENERAL AND BROAD HELPS STAFF IN OUR ANALYSIS. RIGHT? SOMETIMES, IF THE IF THE POLICY LANGUAGE IS TOO NARROW. IT'S ALMOST NOT HELPFUL. SO AS STAFF ANALYZES BILLS AND LEGISLATION COMING THROUGH.
YOU KNOW, AS LONG AS AND STAFF WOULD DO THE ANALYSIS IF IT'S COMPREHENSIVE, AND IT SPEAKS TO WHAT THE LEGISLATION OR FUNDING IS ABOUT, WE'D BE ABLE TO BE RESPONSIVE. HAVING SAID THAT NOW THAT WE HAVE TOWNSEND, WE'LL ALSO HAVE
A BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO GO OVER THIS WORK WITH HIM AND HIS NICOLA AND HIS TEAM. SO IT'S POSSIBLE, AFTER WE GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS, THAT WE'LL BE BACK IN FRONT OF COUNCIL WITH SOME AREAS THAT THEY MIGHT RECOMMEND. SO IT MIGHT, WE MIGHT DEVELOP THESE AREAS A BIT FURTHER, BECAUSE WE'LL LOOK AT TOWNSEND TO LOOK AT OUR LEGISLATIVE PLATFORM GOING FORWARD. YOU KNOW. I DON'T KNOW IF CITY MANAGER HAS ANY FURTHER
COMMENTS, BUT
THANK YOU. AND AND SO SO I APPRECIATE THAT. SO SO, MY, YOU KNOW, KIND OF THE THE DETAILED QUESTION HERE IS, WE LAY OUT THESE LEGISLATIVE KIND OF GOALS FOR ADVOCACY POSITIONS FOR THE YEAR END OF JANUARY STANDARD POLICY. NORMALLY, WE DON'T REVISIT THEM UNLESS IT'S A SPECIFIC LIKE NARROW. OH, WE DIDN'T CAPTURE THIS UPCOMING ISSUE.
ARE YOU PROPOSING THAT NOW THAT WE HAVE TOWNSEND ON BOARD TO COME BACK.
YOU KNOW, IN 6 MONTHS TO TO LET'S SAY FOR A FEW MONTHS WHATEVER THAT TIMEFRAME IS TO DO AN UPDATE SO THAT THAT THERE'S SOMETHING WE'VE MISSED. NOW THAT THAT YOU KNOW WE WE PUT THIS TOGETHER
RELATIVELY QUICK, AND YOU KNOW, AND TOWNSEND HAS ONLY BEEN PART OF THE TEAM FOR LESS THAN 30 DAYS. AT THIS POINT. IS IT IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT WE WILL, AFTER THEY'VE EVALUATED THIS MORE. BRING THIS BACK, OR OR JUST LEAVE THIS THE WAY IT IS, WITH WHATEVER DIRECTION COUNCIL CONCEIVABLY HAS TONIGHT, AND DEAL WITH ANY ADDITIONAL. LET'S SAY, GENERAL TOPICS THAT WE MIGHT HAVE MISSED.
THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION. WE WOULD DEFINITELY SO. 1ST OF ALL, TOWNSEND'S ALREADY LOOKED AT OUR LEGISLATIVE ACTION POLICIES, AND AND
THE ONE AS EXISTED, WE WOULD ALWAYS REMAIN NIMBLE IF WE NEEDED AN ADJUSTMENT WE WOULD COME BACK TO COUNCIL. BUT WE THINK THESE ARE BROAD ENOUGH THAT WE WE DON'T ANTICIPATE A NEED TO COME BACK BEFORE THE
NORMAL ANNUAL PROCESS. BUT WE, OF COURSE, WOULD COME BACK IF IF CONDITIONS WARRANTED IT.
OKAY, I APPRECIATE THAT. AND THEN SO
LOOKING AT THE 6 TOPICS THAT I'VE LISTED HERE, I THINK ALL OF THEM ARE CAPTURED IN SOME WAY, GENERALLY FROM FROM IN KIND OF, YOU KNOW, TRYING TO MAP THEM DIRECTLY AND AND EVEN WHAT COUNCIL MEMBER MELLINGER SAID ABOUT TRANSPORTATION. THERE'S NOT SOMETHING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT FUNDING. BUT IT'S KIND OF LIKE IT'S ADVOCATE, FOR, YOU KNOW, TRANSPORTATION. AND SO, WHETHER OR NOT WE NEED TO ADD ADDITIONAL
COMMENTS ABOUT FUNDING IN GENERAL, BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHERE FUNDING, BECAUSE SEARCHING FOR FUNDING
WE TALKED ABOUT RESTORING FUNDING. BUT
IT TALKS ABOUT LOCAL GOVERNMENT. SO SO I'M I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE FROM A FUNDING STANDPOINT, AND I THINK THAT APPLIES IN GENERAL
WHETHER OR NOT IT'S LOCAL TRANSPORTATION. AND I WOULD. YOU KNOW THIS IS THE QUESTION OF
OF SPECIFICITY VERSUS GENERALNESS.
I WOULD SAY FUNDING, FOR YOU KNOW, GENERAL FUNDING FOR TRANSPORTATION HOUSING. YOU KNOW, I UNDERSTAND WHAT COUNCILMEMBER MELLINGER SAID SPECIFICALLY ABOUT CALTRAIN, AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS
THAT BEING SAID, IT'S
IT'S LOOKING AT WHAT THAT FINE IT'S TO ME. IT ISN'T ADVOCATING SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT FUNDING. IT'S ALSO ADVOCATING FOR BEING PART OF THAT DIALOGUE. AND SO IT'S THE LOCAL CONTROL. IT'S THE LOCAL ADVOCACY. AND THEN IT'S BEING PART OF THAT FUNDING DISCUSSION. SO IT'S NOT SPECIFICALLY, YES, WE WANT THE FUNDING, WHICH YES, WE DO WANT THE FUNDING
WHETHER OR NOT IT'S LOCAL OR REGIONAL. BUT IT'S TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAPTURE THAT NUANCE OF ADVOCATING FOR A DIALOGUE AND THEN ADVOCATING THE ACTUAL FUNDING.
AS LONG AS THAT'S CAPTURED HERE. WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S TRANSPORTATION HOUSING CORRECTLY, AND
LOT OF DIFFERENT DOCUMENTS. I'M TRYING TO CROSS REFERENCE AND HAVING, LET'S SAY, SOME DIFFICULTY. I WOULD LIKE, YOU KNOW, YOUR OPINION ON ON THE BEST. TAKE OF THAT.
WHOEVER WANTS TO LISTEN.
I GUESS WE'LL TAKE TURNS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION, MAYOR. I'M JUST LOOKING AT THE FISCAL MANAGEMENT LONG TERM POLICIES, AND I MEAN WE HAVE SOME GENERAL LANGUAGE IN THERE. I ALSO THINK, YOU KNOW, DEPENDING ON A REGIONAL MEASURE. THERE MAY BE SOME THAT COUNCIL WOULD WANT TO EVALUATE SPECIFICALLY, AND WE COULD CERTAINLY, DEPENDING ON A SPECIFIC CONTEXT, BRING A SPECIFIC ITEM TO COUNCIL IF
THAT WERE WARRANTED. SO THIS DOESN'T PRECLUDE US FROM DOING THAT. IF THE GENERAL LANGUAGE IN ANY CERTAIN SPECIFIC CONTEXT ISN'T CLEAR ENOUGH.
I APPRECIATE THAT. AND AND THAT'S WHAT YOU KNOW.
HAVING THAT FLEXIBILITY HAS SERVED THIS COUNCIL, THE MAYOR AND STAFF WELL
IN THE IN THE PAST, YOU KNOW DEFINITELY. EVERY NOW AND THEN THERE WAS. THERE WERE CERTAIN ISSUES THAT CAME UP, THAT WE WEREN'T CAPTURED, THAT WE SPECIFICALLY HAD TO BRING BACK TO COUNCIL FOR THAT. BUT I THINK IN GENERAL.
YOU KNOW AT LEAST
THE WAY I TAKE IT, I THINK THE ISSUES THAT I BROUGHT UP AT LEAST MONDAY MORNING QUESTIONS ARE COVERED THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH FLEXIBILITY TO TAKE A STANCE ON THEM IF NEED BE.
OKAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT CONFIRMATION QUESTION FOR TOWNSEND.
SO I APPRECIATE WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT KEY STATE ISSUES FOR 2025.
MOST OF THOSE ARE, I'LL SAY.
THE YEARLY ISSUES THAT WE HAVE. ALL THE WILDFIRES HAVE BROUGHT, YOU KNOW.
SOMETHING TO THE FOREFRONT AND AND DEFINITELY, INSURANCE HAS BECOME A BIG ISSUE. I HAVE NOT HEARD ANY LEGISLATION, AND NOT THAT I'M FOLLOWING THE MULTIPLE BILLS THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED RIGHT NOW ABOUT LOCAL ARTISTS CONTRACT PROTECTIONS. CAN YOU?
CAN YOU ENLIGHTEN US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT THOSE ISSUES ARE HAPPY TO? THERE WERE, I'D SAY, MAYBE A HANDFUL OF CITIES IN ABOUT 4 OR 5 COUNTIES IN THE BAY AREA HAD PUBLIC ART PROJECT PROGRAMS, AND THEY WERE MOVING FORWARD. WHETHER IT'S PAINTING UTILITY BOXES, PAYING THE SIDE OF A PARKING LOT.
AND THERE WERE CLAIMS FILED ABOUT NOT FOLLOWING VARIOUS LABOR CODES. SO THOSE SOME OF THOSE CITIES PUT THOSE PROJECTS ON HOLD.
SO IS THAT IS THAT MINIMUM WAGE REQUIREMENTS. OR IS THAT PROCESS FOR
LOW BID REQUIREMENTS? IT'S MORE ALONG THE DID YOU BID PROPERLY? IF YOU LOOK AT THE LABOR CODE IS THIS SKILLED AND TRAINED? YOU'RE USING VOLUNTEERS. CAN YOU USE VOLUNTEERS? WHAT'S SOME OF THE LIABILITY? AND SO I THINK IT MIGHT BE A SENATOR ASHBY FROM SACRAMENTO, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES, PUTTING FORWARD A CLEANUP ON THAT. IT WAS ALSO THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL
HAS IDENTIFIED THAT AS A CONCERN. AND SO IT'S KIND OF FLOATING AROUND THROUGHOUT DIFFERENT BARRY COUNTIES OF NOTICES SAYING, PUT YOUR THOSE PROJECTS ON HOLD.
GOT IT? AND I AND I APPRECIATE THAT. SO YEAH, DEFINITELY, IF THERE ARE THERE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO AS WE'RE
DEFINING, YOU KNOW ART WITHIN OUR CITY. AND AND SO WE HAVE OUR PROGRAMS AND OUR ART MASTER PLAN, YOU KNOW, BEYOND LEGISLATION ADVOCACY. ARE THERE THINGS THAT YOU KNOW WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT? I APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE DEFINITELY, THERE WERE QUESTIONS. SO WE'VE HAD RESIDENTS RAISE THE ISSUE OF.
ARE THEY GETTING APPROPRIATE MINIMUM WAGE? AND IT'S LIKE, WELL, THEY'RE GETTING PAID FOR MATERIALS AS WELL AS A LUMP SUM, AND SOME OF THEM DO IT FAR LESS THAN THAN THE HOURS THAT WOULD BE PUT IN FROM A MINIMUM WAGE STANDPOINT, AND SOME OF THEM
ARE ARE PERFECTIONISTS AND SPEND ADDITIONAL HOURS IN COMPARISONS. THERE'S NOT APPLES TO APPLES WHEN WE'RE WHEN WE'RE DOING THOSE BIDS OR BASICALLY THOSE REQUESTS FOR PROPOSALS FOR A PROJECT. AND SO, YEAH, SO I'M INTERESTED IN THAT.
JUST I HADN'T SEEN THAT ONE CALLED OUT SPECIFICALLY, THE REST OF THOSE ARE, LET'S SAY, EITHER THE YEARLY OR LIKE THE TIME. THE CURRENT ISSUE OF THE DAY. TO SOME DEGREE CAP AND TRADE IS DEFINITELY A HOT TOPIC. AS A COUNCIL MEMBER MENTIONED TRANSPORTATION MEASURES, WHETHER ALL 9 COUNTIES OR JUST A FEW
AND OF COURSE, YOU KNOW, WE'LL SEE WHAT COMES OUT IN THE NEXT MONTH OF DIFFERENT BILLS, TOO. ABSOLUTELY OKAY.
AND THEN ONE SECOND, SORRY. NO, NO WORRIES. AND THEN, AS FAR AS I KNOW, YOU REPRESENT MULTIPLE CITIES. CORRECT, DO YOU DO. AND I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE UPDATING STAFF.
DO YOU DO QUARTERLY REPORTS? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT IS YOUR KIND OF UPDATES TO
EDUCATE COUNCIL AT THE END OF THE DAY. IT IS. WHATEVER WORKS FOR YOU ALL, WE TRY TO BE EXTREMELY USER FRIENDLY. WE LIKE TO DO FRIDAY EMAIL UPDATES THAT CAN BE SHARED WITH ALL ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS HAPPENING IN SACRAMENTO AND DC, YOU ALL WANT ME AND THE TEAM TO COME BY MONTHLY QUARTERLY.
ABSOLUTELY. IT'S REALLY WHATEVER WORKS FOR YOU ALL. I GET TEASED IN THE OFFICE. AND I'M ON THE PHONE A LOT BECAUSE I LIKE TO HAVE THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH EVERYONE THAT WE WORK WITH TO GET A REAL UNDERSTANDING OF EVERYTHING YOU ARE DEALING WITH. SO WE ARE EXTREMELY USER, FRIENDLY. AND WHATEVER MODES OF COMMUNICATION AND FREQUENCY THAT WORKS FOR ALL OF YOU.
NEXT UP IS COUNCIL MEMBER MELLINGER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THIS IS FOR TOWNSEND. SORRY, SIR. NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT. I'LL JUST STAND UP HERE. I DON'T KNOW WHY I KEEP GOING BACK AND FORTH. SO
THIS IS A A QUESTION THAT JUST CAME TO MIND. YOU REPRESENT MANY CITIES AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES IN THE BAY AREA AND IN THE STATE. CORRECT?
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN CITY A AND CITY B HAVE OPPOSING PRIORITIES? THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS SINCE 98, AND WE HAVE NOT HAD THAT
WE'RE VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHO WE'RE WORKING WITH AND WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON. AND WE'VE ACTUALLY FOUND
WORKING WITH DIFFERENT CITIES, ESPECIALLY NEARBY, HELPS BRING A BETTER COALITION. HOWEVER, OUR FIRM'S POLICY HAS ALWAYS BEEN. IF BY ANY CHANCE THERE IS A CONFLICT, THE CITY WE'VE WORKED WITH LONGER IS WHO WE WORK WITH, AND THEN THE OTHER CITY THAT MIGHT HAVE THE CONFLICT. WE WORK WITH THEM TO GET THEM SUPPORT AND HELP PAY FOR THAT.
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. NO FURTHER QUESTIONS, NO PROBLEM. AND I'M STILL GONNA STAND UP HERE.
THAT THAT WAS OUR LAST QUESTION. SO YOU MAY SIT DOWN. NOW SIT DOWN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
LET ME GO AHEAD AND OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS ITEM, PLEASE SUBMIT. A SPEAKER CARD OF THE CITY CLERK. RAISE YOUR DIGITAL HAND NOW, OR DIAL STAR 9 IN YOUR TELEPHONE. INDICATE THAT YOU WISH TO SPEAK. I WILL CALL MEMBERS OF PUBLIC PARTICIPATING IN PERSON, 1ST FOLLOWED BY REMOTE PARTICIPANTS. SPEAKERS WILL HAVE 3 MIN TO SPEAK. I HAVE NO SPEAKER CARDS IN THE ROOM.
CITY CLERK. DO WE HAVE ANY REMOTE PARTICIPANTS WISHING TO SPEAK ON THIS ITEM.
NO, MAYOR.
OKAY, I WILL GO AHEAD AND CLOSE OUR PUBLIC HEARING AND BRING IT BACK TO COUNCIL COUNCILMEMBER. MELLINGER.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I HAVE A FEW POSSIBLE
PRIORITIES THAT I'D LIKE TO RAISE, AND YOU KNOW WE I THINK MAYBE WE GO THROUGH THESE ONE AT A TIME. IF THAT'S OKAY, ARE YOU PROPOSING A MOTION WITH, WOULD YOU? WOULD YOU LIKE? I'M KIND OF. I WANT TO PULL BACK MORE A STRAW POLL BEFORE I START MAKING A MOTION. OKAY? AND AND BEFORE YOU DO THAT, CAN YOU CLARIFY? I'M ASSUMING WITH WITH STAFF IF YOU COULD ASK
WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE CURRENTLY CAPTURED, YOU KNOW, BEFORE YOU
PROPOSE A STRAW POLL FOR FOR EACH OF THESE RIGHT, I WANT TO THROW THESE OUT HERE INFORMALLY BEFORE I MAKE ANY KIND OF MOTION.
SO THE 1ST ONE, I'M GOING TO SAY, AND THIS IS SORT OF ALIGNED WITH THE, YOU KNOW, SUPPORT LEGISLATION REGARDING OUR STATEMENT OF VALUES. I DON'T REMEMBER THE EXACT WORDING ON THAT
SOMETHING I HAVE HAD IN MY NOTES FOR A WHILE TO PROPOSE IS A LEGISLATIVE POSITION TO SUPPORT THE CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS OF SUNNYVALE COMMUNITY MEMBERS. WE SAW A QUESTION ABOUT, YOU KNOW, SUPPORTING THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY WE HAVE, I THINK THIS IS SORT OF VERY ALIGNED WITH THE EXISTING LANGUAGE ON THE STATEMENT OF VALUES, BUT IS PERHAPS A BIT STRONGER. DOES STAFF HAVE THOUGHTS ON THAT SORT OF LANGUAGE.
I THINK THAT WOULD BE A COUNCIL'S DIRECTION.
OKAY, SO THAT WOULD BE THE SORT OF THING THAT WE COULD
ADD IN IF WE FELT SO MOVED.
OKAY,
SOMETHING THAT IS STILL A SORE SPOT. 2 YEARS LATER, AFTER GOING THROUGH THE HOUSING ELEMENT PROCESS, WAS THE AMOUNT OF GUESS AND CHECK THAT WE WERE PLAYING WITH HCD. AND THE LONG TIMELINES INVOLVED IN THAT.
AND
SO I HAD IN MIND A POSITION. WHAT I'VE GOT WRITTEN DOWN HERE IS SUPPORT, INCREASED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND OBJECTIVE EVALUATION, CRITERIA FOR HOUSING, ELEMENT CERTIFICATION, INCLUDING MODEL PROGRAM LANGUAGE.
AND SO THE IDEA HERE IS.
LOOK, JUST TELL US WHAT YOU WANT.
PLEASE TELL US WHAT YOU WANT, AND WE'LL DO IT, BUT DON'T MAKE US GUESS
AND I IMAGINE THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO ASK STAFF TO COME BACK WITH LANGUAGE ON.
YEAH, I THINK THAT WOULD BE A BETTER APPROACH, SO WE CAN DISCUSS IT INTERNALLY A LITTLE BIT. AND DO WE THINK THAT'S ALREADY COVERED? OR IS THAT SOMETHING
THAT THAT FEELS A LITTLE OUT THERE?
WELL, IT MIGHT, DID YOU? WANNA
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE YOU WERE ALREADY AWARE OF THE BULLET THAT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES THE HOUSING ELEMENT.
SO I DON'T THINK IT GETS INTO THAT LEVEL OF MAYBE OPERATIONAL
PREFERENCES OR DETAILED ADMINISTRATIVE PREFERENCES. BUT IT DOES SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THE HOUSING ELEMENT, AND THAT IS
IN SECTION 5 OF THE 2025 PRIORITY ADVOCACY ISSUES.
I WILL SAY I DON'T FEEL THIS IS COVERED BY THAT LANGUAGE. SO IF MY COLLEAGUES ARE SUPPORTIVE, I WOULD BE OF A MIND TO ASK STAFF TO COME BACK WITH SOMETHING ON THAT FRONT. IT'S NOT TOO EARLY TO START PREPARING FOR THE NEXT ROUND OF HOUSING ELEMENT.
YEAH. YEAH. WELL, AND WE'RE ALREADY ALMOST HALFWAY THROUGH. SO COULD I JUST ADD A COMMENT ON THAT. YES, COUNCIL MEMBER MELLINGER. SO JUST SO YOU'RE AWARE HCD. DOES ALREADY HAVE A LAW THAT REQUIRES THEM TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. NOW, WHETHER THEY'RE DOING A GOOD JOB OR NOT ON THAT COULD BE DEBATED. BUT THEY DO ALREADY HAVE QUITE A BIT OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT THEY
SAY THEY OFFER THAT THEY SAY THEY OFFER THAT IS VERY DELICATELY PHRASED. OKAY, THAT'S THAT'S HELPFUL.
SO THE NEXT ONE I HAVE IS THIS IS SUPPORT REGIONAL FUNDING MEASURES FOR TRANSPORTATION AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING, AND FOR THE MAYOR. A LOT OF THAT FEELS LIKE IT'S ALREADY COVERED, BUT I'D LIKE TO ADD SOME SPECIFIC COLOR THERE.
THAT AGAIN. THIS MAY NOT NEED TO BE IN WRITTEN DOWN, BUT I'D LIKE TO GET THIS ON THE RECORD. SO 1ST OF ALL, THERE'S SB. 63, WHICH IS AN INTENT BILL FROM SENATOR WEINER FOR A REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION FUNDING MEASURE. AND I, YOU KNOW, WOULD WANT TO CALL THAT OUT AS SOMETHING TO BE WATCHING VERY CLOSELY. I DON'T THINK WE NEED ANY SPECIFIC DIRECTION IN A MOTION FOR THAT, BUT I WANT TO GET THAT ON THE RECORD.
WE HAD THE REGIONAL HOUSING BOND WHICH FAILED LAST YEAR DUE TO A LAWSUIT. THERE'S LIKELY GOING TO BE SOME SORT OF RETURN OF THAT. AND AGAIN, I IMAGINE THAT'S ALREADY IMPLICITLY COVERED IN WHAT WE'RE DOING.
THERE IS SOMETHING VERY SPECIFIC, THOUGH, THAT MIGHT MAKE FOR A SHORT TERM ADVOCACY, POSITION, OR PRIORITY ADVOCACY POSITION. AND THIS CAME OUT OF THE CALTRAIN OPMG MEETING LAST WEEK. CALTRAIN CURRENTLY RECOVERS 23% OF ITS ELECTRICITY THROUGH REGENERATIVE BRAKING, AND THEY RECEIVE 0 CREDIT FOR THAT. THEY DO NOT GET ANY MONEY BACK, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY'VE ESSENTIALLY, YOU KNOW, PUTTING 23% OF THEIR POWER BACK IN THE SYSTEM.
THEY SPEND 16 MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ON POWER. SO THAT WOULD BE ALMOST 4 MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR WHICH, GIVEN THEIR CURRENT BUDGET DEFICIT
IS MEANINGFUL. SO, PERHAPS DISCUSSING WITH CALTRAIN STAFF WHETHER WE COULD COORDINATE ON AN ADVOCACY POSITION.
A SHORT TERM, ADVOCACY, POSITION OR LETTER ON THE REGENERATIVE BREAKING ISSUE COULD BE WORTH DOING.
AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE FORMAL STAFF DIRECTION. BUT I WANTED TO CALL THAT OUT EXPLICITLY, BECAUSE
I MEAN, HONESTLY, IF THIS CAN SAVE CALTRAIN 4 MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR, IF IT EVEN SAVES A FRACTION OF THAT, THAT'S A VERY MEANINGFUL IMPACT.
I'VE MADE NOTE OF BOTH OF THOSE, AND WE CAN ADD THEM TO OUR OUR TRACKING LIST. I DID WANT TO NOTE ON THE ON YOUR HOUSING BOND COMMENT THAT THERE ACTUALLY IS STILL LANGUAGE PROPOSED IN THE 2025 LAPS UNDER ITEM 5, AS WELL REGARDING THE BAY AREA HOUSING FINANCE AUTHORITY. SO IF THEY WERE TO BRING SOMETHING BACK, I THINK YOU HAVE LANGUAGE THAT WOULD COVER THAT PARTICULAR ITEM.
FANTASTIC. OKAY.
THE LAST ITEM I WOULD LIKE TO RAISE, AND I'M GOING TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BACKGROUND COLOR ON THIS. SOMETHING I'VE SAID BEFORE IS THAT THE CEQA REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IS REALLY QUITE BADLY OUTDATED. IT WAS DESIGNED FOR AN ERA WHEN THE CHIEF ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERN WAS PEOPLE DOING BAD THINGS, AND WE NEED TO SLOW IT DOWN AND STOP IT. WE WANT TO STOP THE PERSON FROM PUTTING A PAINT FACTORY IN A POOR NEIGHBORHOOD AS AN EXAMPLE.
THE CRISIS WE ARE FACING NOW. THE CLIMATE CRISIS REQUIRES MAJOR RAPID ACTION.
AND SO IN MANY CASES, CEQA HAS BECOME AN OBSTACLE
TO CREATING THE KIND OF POLICY CHANGE NECESSARY TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE AT THE SCALE AND AT THE SPEED THAT IS REQUIRED.
AND SO I WOULD BE OF A MIND AT A LEGISLATIVE ADVOCACY POSITION ADVOCATING FOR MODERNIZING CEQA, AND TO BETTER ENABLE MAJOR PROJECTS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE.
AND SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I RECOGNIZE. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY SOMETHING. I'D WANT STAFF TO COME BACK WITH LANGUAGE ON
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD BE COVERED UNDER ANY OF OUR EXISTING POSITIONS.
COUNCILMEMBER MILLINGER. I'M NOT IMMEDIATELY AWARE OF ANYTHING THAT WOULD COVER THAT
WE WILL CONTINUE LOOKING, OR WE COULD BE DIRECTED TO COME BACK ON THAT.
OKAY, SO THOSE WERE THE 4 I WANTED TO RAISE.
SO OF THESE
IT WOULD BE LOOKING LIKE, MAYBE ASKING STAFF TO COME BACK WITH LANGUAGE ABOUT CEQA REFORM AND LANGUAGE, ABOUT HOUSING ELEMENT, TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.
AND THEN MAYBE DIRECTLY MODIFYING THE LANGUAGE ON REGARDING THE STATEMENT OF VALUES. AND I'M NOT GONNA MAKE A MOTION NOW, BECAUSE I WANT TO GIVE MY COLLEAGUES THE OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE ANY ISSUES THEY WANT TO BRING UP.
THANK YOU. AND BEFORE WE GET TO THE OTHER COUNCIL MEMBERS, I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU KEEP YOUR MIC ON JUST IN CASE A LITTLE FEEDBACK AT LEAST, HOW I TAKE THAT
I WOULDN'T TALK ABOUT CEQA MODERNIZATION.
IT'S A MIX. I I WOULDN'T NARROW IT TO JUST ENABLING AND SPEEDING, BECAUSE THERE'S ALSO OTHER COMPONENTS OF CEQA. AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT PREVIOUSLY, THE EXTERNAL IMPLICATIONS OF A SITE AS OPPOSED TO THE EFFECTS OF A SPECIFIC SITE, ON THE EXTRA, ON THE, ON THE EXTERNAL. THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER THINGS FROM A SEQUENCE. SO SO THE MORE GENERAL STAFF CAN MAKE THESE
THE BETTER. AND THEN, AS WE'RE GOING THROUGH LEGISLATION, LEGISLATIVE ADVOCACY, IT'S IT'S TO ME. IT'S A LOT. IT'S A LOT MORE FLEXIBLE. SO SIMILARLY SO YOU KNOW, FUNDING FOR TRANSPORTATION AND HOUSING
ADVOCATE, FOR YOU KNOW.
BEING PART OF THE DIALOGUE AND ALL THAT. SIMILARLY FOR FOR SEQUEL MODERNIZATION, THE GENERAL THING, BECAUSE, DEPENDING UPON
WHAT'S BEING DONE. CONCEIVABLY, YOU KNOW, BUILDING NEXT TO THE BAY ISN'T A GOOD THING, OR BUILDING FIRE, SO TO TO SPEED UP CEQA
FOR BUILDING IN A FIRE ZONE ISN'T RIGHT. AND SO SO TO NARROW. TO KEEP THAT NARROW ISN'T IN ANYONE'S BEST INTEREST TO SAY, THAT'S THE WAY WE'RE GOING TO ADVOCATE, REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE BILL IS. AND SO SO THIS IS
GIVING STAFF FLEXIBILITY OF. OKAY, THERE'S SQL MODERNIZATION.
WHATEVER THAT ENTAILS. AND I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE ALLOWING STAFF TO GET, HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY. BUT WE DON'T AT THIS POINT KNOW
WHAT BILLS MIGHT BE PROPOSED. AND SO YEAH, SO I JUST SO, FOR WHATEVER THE FINAL MOTION IS, I THINK THAT'S THAT'S A CRITICAL THING. BUT I DO. I DO AGREE. THAT HAVING THOSE ITEMS, THE 3 ITEMS THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT
DO MAKE SENSE POINT WELL TAKEN, AND WHAT I'LL SAY I DON'T BELIEVE IN DEREGULATION. WHAT I BELIEVE IS IN IS CORRECT REGULATION, AND THERE ARE AREAS WHERE CEQA MAY BE TOO LENIENT, AND THERE ARE AREAS WHERE CEQA MAY BE TOO STRICT.
AND SO WHAT I MIGHT PHRASE THAT, AS IS SOMETHING LIKE SUPPORT, MODERNIZATION OF CEQA TO EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS MODERN ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES, SUCH AS CLIMATE CHANGE SOUNDS GOOD. YES, SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
VICE, MAYOR SAID
SO. HAD A QUESTION.
SO IN OUR CLIMATE ACTION PLAN, TRANSPORTATION IS A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF HOW WE CAN ADDRESS REDUCE
GREENHOUSE GASES. SO WHEN I LOOK AT THESE PRIORITY ADVOCACY ISSUES LIKE, I SEE.
HIGH LEVEL, A LOT OF DIFFERENT AREAS.
I DON'T SEE TRANSPORTATION IN THERE, BUT THEN
MAYOR KLEIN BROUGHT IT UP IN HIS POINTS, AND THEN THEN IT POINTS TO DIFFERENT DOCUMENTS. SO SAY, THERE WAS LIKE SOME TRANSPORTATION
MONEY AT THE STATE LEVEL, AND
IS THERE ABILITY FOR A TOWN CENTER FOR US TO GO AFTER GRANTS RELATED TO TRANSPORTATION, EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT REALLY A PRIORITY ADVOCACY ISSUE. BUT IT'S DOWN THERE IN SOME DOCUMENTS LIKE.
HOW?
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT?
YES, VICE MAYOR, SELL ABSOLUTELY. WE HAVE APPROVED COUNCIL, APPROVED PLANS, COUNCIL APPROVED, ADOPTED BUDGET, INCLUDING OUR 20 YEAR CAPITAL PLAN. SOME OF THOSE PROJECTS ARE UNFUNDED. WE ARE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR FUNDING FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE COUNCIL APPROVED PROJECTS AND PLANS.
AND WE WOULD BE COMPLYING WITH OUR GRANTS POLICY AND COMING FORWARD TO COUNCIL IN THE CASES WHEN DIRECTION REGARDING ANY GRANT AWARDS IS REQUIRED.
AND SO WE WOULDN'T NEED ADDITIONAL
LANGUAGE IN THESE DOCUMENTS TO CONTINUE LOOKING FOR THAT TYPE OF FUNDING. OKAY? AND THEN, LAST THING IS, THERE'S MANY THINGS WE HAVE. TOWNSEND HELP US WORK ON.
IS OUR STRATEGIC PRIORITY SOMETHING THAT KIND OF GUIDES US TO WHERE TO TARGET THEIR RESOURCES FOR US.
GREAT QUESTION, AND THROUGH OUR ONBOARDING PROCESS WITH THEM ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES OF HAVING ONE FIRM DO STATE AND FEDERAL AND SOME STRATEGIC GRANT SUPPORT IS THAT WE CAN LOOK AT THAT COMPREHENSIVELY WITH THE THE TOWNSEND TEAM. WE WOULD USE THIS LEGISLATIVE ADVOCACY, POLICY AND POSITIONS THAT COUNCIL IS CONSIDERING TONIGHT AS ONE PRIORITY FOR THAT CONVERSATION. WE WOULD ALSO USE
DOCUMENTS LIKE THE, YOU KNOW, ADOPTED PLANS AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE PLANS AND AND CIP BUDGET
AS PART OF THAT STRATEGY, AND WE WOULD WORK WITH THEM TO IDENTIFY
WHICH THINGS WE MAY BE MORE COMPETITIVE FOR FOR GRANT FUNDING. AND THEN WHICH THINGS STRATEGICALLY, WE MAY BE BETTER ALIGNED FOR FOR THE FEDERAL AND STATE BUDGET PROCESS REQUESTS.
OKAY, THAT'S GREAT. AND YEAH, I'VE ONLY BEEN HERE 2 YEARS ON THE COUNCIL. BUT THESE STRATEGIES THAT SUNNYVALE PUTS IN PLACE SO THAT WE CAN BE MORE AGILE AND STILL FULFILL THE WILL OF THE COUNCIL AND THE PEOPLE THAT ELECT US. SO I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO MAKE THE PROCESS CONTINUALLY BETTER.
THANK YOU. VICE MAYOR. NEXT UP IS COUNCIL MEMBER CISNEROS.
YEAH, THANK YOU. STAFF.
FOLKS WHO HAVE OUR NEW FIRM REALLY APPRECIATE HEARING ALL OF THIS
TONIGHT, AND I DON'T HAVE ANY BIG REVOLUTIONARY IDEAS FOR THIS.
LOOKING AT IT, I THINK EVERYONE'S GOING TO BE JUST BUSY ENOUGH
COMING UP WITH MY OWN THINGS TO ADD TO IT. I FEEL LIKE WE ARE LARGELY HITTING THE MARK HERE, AND THAT'S A REALLY GOOD PLACE TO BE, AND LIKING THIS LIKE I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE JUST HOW DOES THIS YEAR GO? AND THEN I MIGHT CONSIDER, SINCE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF CHANGE, THEN GO AHEAD AND REARRANGE BECAUSE WE HAVE A PATH THAT IS REALLY GOING HERE, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE THINGS TO BE SAID ABOUT
STRATEGICALLY.
ACCORDING OUR THE POLICY PRIORITIES WITH WHAT IS GOING ON CURRENTLY AND JUST CATCHING SOME THINGS UP. AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT
ALL I HAVE IS ONE LITTLE LITTLE CHANGE TO ONE. SO IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING, HOMELESSNESS, AND LAND USE. ONE THING THAT I JUST SAW THAT WAS MISSING. THERE WAS PREVENTING HOMELESSNESS FROM OCCURRING, IN THE 1ST PLACE.
AS A PRIORITY AREA TO SUPPORT LEGISLATION ON, BECAUSE THAT IN OF ITSELF ALLEVIATES THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS
TREMENDOUSLY. IF IF WE'RE NOT CONTINUOUSLY GETTING THE INFLUX OF PEOPLE WHO ARE UNABLE TO AFFORD TO LIVE
IN THEIR HOMES GO THROUGH HARD TIMES. SO IT
IN ADDITION, THAT WOULD COVER SOMETHING LIKE THE UBI THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HAVING FINDING FOR FUNDING FOR AT SOME POINT, BUT NOT
ACTIVELY WORKING ON, AND OTHER MEASURES THAT WOULD HELP ALLEVIATE POVERTY IN OUR COMMUNITY. SO I THINK JUST
POLICIES TO PREVENT HOMELESSNESS. HOWEVER, YOU WANT TO WORD. THAT WOULD BE A REALLY GOOD ADDITION TO THAT ONE PIECE.
AND I'M GOING TO SAY I REALLY LIKE THE DIALOGUE HERE I HEARD BETWEEN THE MAYOR AND COUNCIL MEMBER, MELLINGER ABOUT THOSE IDEAS. I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE AND ON BOARD WITH THEM, AND I THINK THAT TOGETHER THROUGH THAT DIALOGUE, YOU KNOW, STRUCK A REALLY GOOD BALANCE. SO I APPRECIATED LISTENING TO THAT. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU. COUNCIL MEMBER.
COUNCIL MEMBER MELLINGER.
I'M READY WITH A MOTION. I 1 MORE. ONE MORE QUESTION. SORRY FOR ME FROM MYSELF.
I WAS GOING THROUGH, AND I WANTED TO RE ADDRESS ENERGY.
AND IT KIND OF APPLIES TO SEVERAL THINGS. AND AND I KNOW YOU SAY THIS CAN BE ADDRESSED IN GOALS AND POLICIES AND GENERAL PLAN, SAFETY, NOISE OR SORRY, RELIABLE ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE, ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT.
I'M TRYING TO CARVE OUT.
THERE'S A THERE'S A FEW ISSUES THAT THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT, AND ONE OF WHICH IS, YOU KNOW NOT SURE WHAT LEGISLATION IS GOING TO COME OUT THIS YEAR REGARDING
ELECTRICITY FROM PG AND E, WHICH IS THE BIG THING.
CPUC CHANGES TO CONCEIVABLY CCAS. AND WHILE CCAS DON'T DIRECTLY AFFECT US, IT'S GIVING THE CITY FLEXIBILITY
TO SIGN ON TO SILICON VALLEY CLEAN ENERGY EFFORTS, AND, YOU KNOW, STATEWIDE EFFORTS TO TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CCAS ARE PROTECTED.
AND I WON'T GIVE YOU MY OPINIONS ON THE PRIVATIZATION OF PG. AND E. AND ALL THAT, BUT BUT TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT
ARE ELECTRICITY RATE PAYERS ARE BEING PROTECTED ACCORDINGLY. AND I'M I'M NOT SURE IF MAY I THINK IT'S
IS IS IT?
AS THINGS CURRENTLY STAND GOOD ENOUGH, OR OR IS IT GOOD TO TALK ABOUT ENERGY AND UTILITY?
PRESERVATION? AND I DON'T KNOW INTEREST, LOCAL INTEREST, BECAUSE IT'S NOT SPECIFICALLY A CITY ISSUE AT AT TIMES. BUT IT IS. IT'S IT'S A REQUIREMENT FOR OUR RESIDENTS, REQUIREMENT FOR BUSINESSES. IT'S THE.
LET'S SAY, THE THE NEED FOR EQUAL GENERATION AS WELL AS DISTRIBUTION AND FAIR
DISTRIBUTION WITHIN THE CITY, WITHIN THE COUNTY, WITHIN THE REGION. AND AND I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S BEING CAPTURED, OR OR DO WE NEED TO TO AT LEAST GIVE A LET'S SAY BULLET ITEM, JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT IF THAT COMES UP
THAT IT'S THERE.
I THINK THAT'S A BULLET THAT COUNCIL COULD DIRECT US TO TO COME BACK WITH LANGUAGE, FOR I APPRECIATE THAT, BECAUSE, YEAH, IT'S IT'S INTERMIXED WITH ALL THIS, AND NOT THAT IT'S BECOME AN ISSUE YET.
BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT
PERSONALLY, I'VE BEEN, YOU KNOW, ADVOCATING DIRECTLY WITH PG. AND E. OR WITH THE LEGISLATORS, AND I THINK YOU KNOW, SEEING, CONTINUED FIREFIGHTER FIRES, AND
HOW THAT RELATES TO ELECTRICITY. AND YOU KNOW, BEING PART OF CCA.
SEEING THEY'RE AT ODDS OF WHAT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING FROM A CPU STANDPOINT. SO I APPRECIATE THAT.
AND I THINK THAT WAS MY ONLY FINAL COMMENT.
BACK TO YOU, COUNCIL MEMBER, MELLON. MR. MAYOR, BEFORE I MAKE MY MOTION. CAN I ASK YOU TO BOIL DOWN THAT CONVERSATION? YOU JUST HAD YOUR BULLET POINT FOR ABSOLUTELY THE BULLET. THE BULLET POINT, AS I WOULD STATE IT, IS
ADVOCATING FOR FAIR ENERGY, DISTRIBUTION AND
PRICING PRICING. THAT SOUNDS THAT SOUNDS GOOD.
OKAY,
AND IF MY COLLEAGUES WANT ME TO SEND THIS TO MR. CARNAHAN TO PUT ON THE SCREEN. I CAN DO SO. BUT I'M GONNA JUST TAKE A STAB AT THIS. NOW.
WE'RE GONNA MOVE STAFF RECOMMENDATION. WITH THE FOLLOWING 6 CHANGES, ONE.
RETURN WITH LANGUAGE TO SUPPORT, OBJECTIVE EVALUATION, CRITERIA AND IMPROVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR HOUSING ELEMENT CERTIFICATION.
2.
RETURN WITH LANGUAGE TO SUPPORT MODERNIZATION OF CEQA. TO BETTER ADDRESS CONTEMPORARY ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES, SUCH AS CLIMATE CHANGE, 3.
RETURN RETURN WITH LANGUAGE, ADVOCATING FOR PROGRAMS AND POLICIES TO PREVENT HOMELESSNESS FROM OCCURRING. IN THE 1ST PLACE.
4. RETURN WITH LANGUAGE, ADVOCATING FOR FAIR ENERGY, DISTRIBUTION, AND PRICING FINE.
ADD LANGUAGE TO
THE ONE ABOUT THE STATEMENT OF VALUES TO INCLUDE SUPPORT CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS OF SUNNYVALE COMMUNITY MEMBERS 6.
RETAIN AND MODIFY POLICY. 7.0 F. 11.
ADVOCATE FOR SUNNYVALE COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST DURING REDISTRICTING CYCLES AFFECTING OUR CITY.
THAT DOES IT, I THINK.
THANK YOU.
IS THERE A SECOND COUNCIL MEMBER? CISNEROS? YEAH, I'LL SECOND QUEUE MOTION.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. MAYOR, AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH, STAFF, FOR AN EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE PRESENTATION, AND FOR HARD WORK ON ALL OF THESE ITEMS, MISS. AS USUAL. YOU'VE DONE A BANG UP JOB. I'M VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH TOWNSEND GOING FORWARD. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING SEEING THE LANGUAGE COME BACK ON THE MODIFICATIONS THAT WE'VE PROPOSED. I THINK THESE ARE RELATIVELY MODEST TWEAKS THAT
ADDRESS SOME PRETTY IMPORTANT AREAS OF CONCERN FOR OUR COMMUNITY IN THE COMING YEARS. I RESPECTFULLY URGE MY COLLEAGUES. I VOTE. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER.
AND I JUST WANT TO THANK COUNCIL FOR THE GOOD DIALOGUE. YOU KNOW. I THINK WHAT WE'VE ENDED UP HERE IS AT LEAST
A GOOD DIRECTION FOR 2025. I APPRECIATE STAFF'S HARD WORK, AND YOU KNOW I DID FIND YOU KNOW
THE EFFORTS OF CAL CITIES THAT UP THAT UPDATE OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH. AND THEN I APPRECIATE TOWNSEND'S APPEARANCE TONIGHT, LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. I THINK YOU KNOW IT'S IT IS A MOVING TARGET, ESPECIALLY FOR THE 1ST 2 MONTHS OF THE YEAR, AND THEN MIDYEAR YET AGAIN ON THE RIP AND REPLACE BILLS THAT WE'RE ALWAYS WORRIED ABOUT. BUT BUT
I DO THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF VALUE THAT TOWNSEND CAN PROVIDE, ESPECIALLY AS WE TALK ABOUT GRANT WRITING. THAT'S KIND OF SEPARATE FROM THE BILLS THAT ARE THERE. BUT BUT I THINK WHAT WE'VE ENDED UP WITH IS IS A GOOD, YOU KNOW, SET OF ADVOCACY POSITIONS, AND AS WE'RE AS IT'S COMING BACK, YOU KNOW, NOT NARROWING US TOO MUCH ON ANY ON ANY OF THESE ISSUES, SO THAT WE HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY TO TO DEAL WITH.
LAST MINUTE CHANGES TO BILLS THAT OFTEN COME, THAT THAT STAFF OR COUNCIL, OR THE MAYOR TAKE, TAKE TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ADVOCATING IN OUR CITY'S BEST INTEREST IN OUR RESIDENTS. BEST INTEREST. SO SO THANK YOU FOR GOING THROUGH THAT PROCESS. AND WITH THAT CITY CLERK. CAN YOU PLEASE CONDUCT A VOTE?
THE MOTION CARRIES 7 0.
THANK YOU. AND, MR. AMERICAN, I KNOW WE'RE LATE. WE'RE ALMOST DONE. BUT CAN I REQUEST A 5 MIN RECESS.
SURE. 5 MIN RECESS COMING BACK. OH, 6 MIN AT 1010 PM. THANK YOU.
LET'S GO AHEAD AND RECONVENE AND MOVE ON TO COUNCIL MEMBER REPORTS ON ACTIVITIES FROM INTERGOVERNMENTAL COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS.
COUNCILMEMBER MALLINGER.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. MAYOR. REGRETTABLY I MISSED THE JANUARY BOSCA MEETING BECAUSE I WAS SICK WITH THE FLU. I WILL TRY TO CATCH A RECORDING OF THAT AND REPORT BACK NEXT MEETING.
I DO HAVE A SOMEWHAT NEWSY UPDATE FROM THE CALTRAIN LOCAL POLICYMAKERS GROUP. I WAS ELECTED VICE CHAIR OF THE LPMG. LAST WEEK. THANK YOU TO SAN JOSE COUNCIL MEMBER PAMELA CAMPOS FOR THE NOMINATION.
WE RECEIVED A REPORT ON RIDERSHIP WITH ELECTRIFICATION. RIDERSHIP IS RECOVERING FASTER THAN EXPECTED FROM THE PANDEMIC, BUT WE ARE STILL ON TRACK
TO RECOVER TO PRE-PANDEMIC LEVELS IN 2034, YEAH, IT IS.
NOW, HOPEFULLY, ELECTRIFICATION WILL HELP TO ACCELERATE THAT TIMETABLE. IT'S ONLY BEEN A FEW MONTHS AND OBVIOUSLY.
THAT'S A AS WITH OUR BUDGET PROJECTIONS. THERE THE FUTURE IS ALWAYS IN MOTION. BUT INCREASING CALTRAIN RIDERSHIP
IS A MAJOR PRIORITY, BECAUSE POINT 2, AS I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY. CALTRAIN IS FACING ROUGHLY A 75 MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR, STRUCTURAL DEFICIT STARTING IN 2026.
AND SO BECAUSE CALTRAIN WAS HISTORICALLY VERY HEAVILY FUNDED BY FARE BOX RECOVERY. IT WAS VERY BOTH CALTRAIN AND BART WERE VERY BADLY HIT BY THE BY COVID DURING THE AND THE RIDERSHIP LOSSES DURING THE PANDEMIC, SO THERE IS A STRONG NEED FOR NEW REVENUE AND COST CONTAINMENT.
SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE ACTIVELY INTERESTED IN AND PURSUING IS THE IDEA OF MEMBER CITIES PROVIDING GO PASSES CALTRAIN GO PASSES FOR THEIR WORKERS TO ENCOURAGE CALTRAIN CITY WORKERS TO COMMUTE BY RAIL. CITY HALL IS PRETTY EASY WALKING DISTANCE FROM THE SUNNYVALE AVENUE CALTRAIN STATION, AND PRETTY EASY BIKING DISTANCE, SO
SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE WORTH DISCUSSING WITH CALTRAIN STAFF. AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY, SENATOR WEINER'S SB. 63, WHICH IS AN INTENT BILL FOR A REGIONAL FUNDING MEASURE.
CALTRAIN IS ALSO EXPLORING POSSIBILITIES FOR ITS OWN FUNDING MEASURE, WHICH COULD TAKE THE FORM AS OF EITHER A SALES TAX OR A PARCEL TAX.
AND THEY HAD A COUPLE DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT THEY OUTLINED FOR THOSE IN THE LAST MEETING.
AND THEN FINALLY,
THE ISSUE OF THE REGENERATIVE BRAKING. IT'S AMAZING THAT THEIR REGENERATIVE BRAKING CAN RETURN 23% OF THEIR CONSUMED POWER TO THE GRID.
AND IT'S FRANKLY, A BIT ABSURD THAT THEY RECEIVE 0 CREDIT OR REFUND FOR THAT.
SO THAT'S A SUMMARY OF LAST WEEK'S LPMG MEETING, AND I THINK THAT DOES IT FOR MY REPORT. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER. NEXT UP IS COUNCIL MEMBER LAY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH. I HAD THE HONOR OF ATTENDING MY 1ST VTA PAC COMMITTEE MEETING LAST 2 WEEKS AGO. 2 WEEKS AGO.
WE VOTED IN A CHAIR AND A VICE CHAIR AND WE UPDATED VOTED TO APPROVE THE VTA LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT POLICY WHICH IS, COMES BEFORE US EVERY 5 YEARS OR SO. AND THEN WE ALSO APPROVED AN UPDATE TO THE BICYCLE SUPERHIGHWAY IMPLEMENTATION PLAN, WHICH IS, AS I THINK WE KNOW, IS GOING TO BE CREATING A NETWORK OF
INTEGRATED AND CONNECTED HIGHWAYS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY, INCLUDING THE EAST CHANNEL TRAIL. HERE IN SUNNYVILLE. ADDITIONALLY, WE TALKED ABOUT UPDATES TO THE VTA STRATEGIC PLAN, AND THERE WAS ADVOCACY FOR THE INCLUSION OF LANGUAGE FOR PRIORITIZING HIGH SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION IN DISTRICTS THAT RELY ON VTA FOR TRANSPORT AS WELL AS A FOCUS ON MICRO TRANSIT, INCLUDING THE
INCLUDING THE VARIOUS SHUTTLES THAT WE HAVE IN THE REGION, AND PRIORITIZING DISABLED AND SENIOR RIDERSHIP.
THAT'S ALL I HAVE. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER SRINIVASAN. THANK YOU, MAYOR. I HAVE 3 UPDATES. ONE IS VALLEY COMMISSION MEETING.
THERE ARE 2 UPDATES ON THAT ONE THE STAFF PROPOSED A E RATE INCREASE FOR VALLEY WATER
WHOLESALE RATES
WHICH SHOULD DEFINITELY AFFECT OUR RETAIL PRICES. ALSO. IT'S NOT IT THEY ARE PRESENTING TO THE BOARD, AND THEN FINALLY, THEY WILL LET US KNOW WHAT WOULD BE THE RAISE.
IT'S PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL FOR SUNNYVALE. SO THAT'S WHAT I CAN SAY AT THIS STAGE.
THE SECOND THING IS I WAS REAPPOINTED TO I ITC IT, AND COMMUNICATION
COMMITTEE OF NLC. FOR 2025.
THIS IS A REAPPOINTMENT.
THEN THE 3RD THING IS INTERESTING. 3 OF US, MAYOR, VICE MAYOR AND I. WE ATTENDED THE
OPENING OF ES ON A STAR HOTEL
SO I PUT IN MY NAME, AND THEN I'M SELECTED FOR I WON THE PRIZE OF ONE DAY. STAY THERE, WHICH I MIGHT DONATE TO SOME OTHER ORGANIZATION OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. BUT THOSE ARE MY UPDATES. THANKS.
THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER MILLINGER.
I HAVE A COUPLE OF RELATED UPDATES THAT COME TO MIND FIRST.ST
I NEED TO WITHDRAW AS THE ALTERNATE TO THE VTA PACK. I DID NOT REALIZE WHEN I RAISED MY HAND FOR THAT THAT HALF OF THE TIME IT WILL BE CONFLICTING WITH BOSCA MEETINGS. AND SO IF
WELL, WE'LL NOT MAKE A MOTION NOW. BUT WE'LL I JUST WANT TO FLAG THAT TO STAFF, AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THE INCONVENIENCE. IT JUST DIDN'T CLICK IN THE MEETING
THAT THEY WERE IN CONFLICT.
THE SECOND THING I WILL NOTE, IS, I AM APPLYING TO THE AIRPORT LAND USE COMMISSION, AND THAT GOES TO THE CITY SELECTION COMMITTEE ON THURSDAY. AND, MR. MAYOR, YOU ARE OUR REPRESENTATIVE TO THE CITY SELECTION COMMITTEE. I HOPE TO BE THERE TO ADVOCATE FOR MYSELF, BUT IN THE EVENT THAT I AM NOT, I'D LIKE TO MAKE CLEAR THAT I'M SPECIFICALLY APPLYING FOR FORMER COUNCIL. MEMBER MELTON SEAT 7.
BECAUSE APPARENTLY
I AM ELIGIBLE FOR BOTH. SEAT 6 AND 6 SEAT 7. ACCORDING TO I MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR BOTH. LET'S LET'S TALK AFTER THIS MEETING. SO THAT'S SOMETHING TO DISCUSS. OKAY, AND THAT DOES IT FOR ME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, AND I'LL
1ST THANK ALL COUNCIL MEMBERS WHO APPLIED FOR DIFFERENT CITIES, ASSOCIATION, SELECTION COMMITTEE SEATS TO REPRESENT OUR COUNTY OR REGION FROM FROM THAT ORGANIZATION. IF YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO ATTEND THAT MEETING. THERE ARE LETTERS OF INTEREST. IF YOU HAVE A STATEMENT THAT YOU WANT ME TO READ, I WILL BE HAPPY TO READ THAT IT'LL BE A 1 MIN ADVOCACY. SO SO KEEP THAT IN MIND.
AND THEN, AS FAR AS
A WEEK AND A HALF AGO, JUST SEEMS LIKE. WEEKS AGO, AT THIS POINT, I WAS IN DC. FOR THE MAYOR'S INNOVATION PROJECT AND THE US. CONFERENCE OF MAYORS. THE WEEK BEFORE INAUGURATION DAY. SO LEFT
THE MONDAY, THE WEDNESDAY AFTER OUR LAST MEETING, AND THEN WAS THERE FOR 5 DAYS, COMING BACK ON SUNDAY. LOTS OF GOOD, YOU KNOW DISCUSSIONS ON MULTIPLE TOPICS.
ONE OF WHICH IS PFAS
IN PFAS, IN FIRE EQUIPMENT AND EXPOSURE. DEFINITELY HAVING DISCUSSIONS WITH WITH STAFF ON THOSE ON THAT CYCLE, BUT LOTS OF GOOD DISCUSSIONS, WITH WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU KNOW THE THE NEW ADMINISTRATION HAD NOT BEEN
SEATED YET, AND SO LOTS OF UNKNOWNS, AND AS WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST WEEK, LOTS OF LOTS OF THINGS CHANGING, BUT THAT BEING SAID, A LAUNDRY LIST OF THINGS TO GIVE TO THE CITY MANAGER, AND AND HAPPY TO, YOU KNOW, REPRESENT THE CITY AT THAT OR THAT AT THAT CONFERENCE. YOU KNOW, VIA WAS THERE
ULTIMATELY TALKING ABOUT MICRO TRANSIT TO THE TO THE INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY SUBCOMMITTEE WHICH I'M ON. THERE WAS CHIP ACT
TASK FORCE DISCUSSIONS. AND AS WE KNOW, WE'RE HAVING SEVERAL FUNDING FOCUSED PROJECTS WITHIN OUR CITY. SO LOTS OF GOOD DISCUSSIONS THERE, AND I DID HAVE THE THE PRIVILEGE TO MEET OUR TOWNSEND DC. STAFF WHILE I WAS ALSO THERE. SO SO IT WAS KIND OF TIMELY THAT WE HAD FINALIZED THAT THAT ENGAGEMENT WITH THEM, AND HAPPY TO
HAVE SOME STAFFING WHEN MEETING CONGRESSMAN KHANNA AND LICCARDO, AS WELL AS THE 2, OUR 2 SENATORS, PADILLA AND SCHIFF. SO SO IT WAS A GOOD. IT WAS A GOOD FEW DAYS, A LITTLE COLD, BUT A GOOD FEW DAYS IN DC. SO HAPPY TO TO REPRESENT OUR CITY THERE
I SEE NO OTHER COMMENTS FROM COUNCIL. I'LL MOVE ON TO NON-AGENDA ITEMS AND COMMENTS, COUNCILMEMBER MELLINGER.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. MAYOR. MR. CARNAHAN, COULD I GET THE 3 STUDY ISSUES I'M PROPOSING TONIGHT? DON'T WORRY. THEY'RE CLONES. BASICALLY
AS YOU ARE AWARE, A YEAR AND A HALF OR 2 YEARS AGO I PROPOSED DPW. 2,402 COMPLETE STREETS, REDESIGN OF FAIR OAKS.
I AM PROPOSING 3 STUDY ISSUES FOR THE 2026 CYCLE
WHICH WOULD SEGMENT THAT STUDY ISSUE
INTO 3 JAVA TO AWANI AWANI TO FAIR OAKS BRIDGE, FAIR OAKS BRIDGE TO EL CAMINO REAL EACH OF THOSE WOULD BECOME ITS OWN STUDY. ISSUE THE CHALLENGE WITH 24, 0, 2 IS THAT IT WAS SO MASSIVE THAT IT WAS ESSENTIALLY
IT WOULD ESSENTIALLY BLOW OUT THE DPW. BUDGET IN TERMS OF STAFF WORK. AND SO I'M HOPING THAT BY SEGMENTING IT THAT CAN PROVIDE WHICH WE'VE ALREADY. I'VE ALREADY PARTIALLY DONE WITH THE BY SPLITTING OUT THE SIGNALIZATION STUDY ISSUE 25. 0, 1. I'M HOPING THAT BY SEGMENTING IT. THIS WILL MAKE IT MORE DIGESTIBLE.
THANK YOU. AND SO, COUNCIL MEMBER MELLINGER IS LOOKING FOR CO-SPONSORS.
YOU CAN JUST OPEN YOUR MIC IF YOU ARE CO-SPONSORING THIS ISSUE. CO-SPONSOR. THANK YOU. COUNCIL MEMBER CISNEROS. SORRY. COULD I ASK A QUESTION? ABSOLUTELY. COUNCIL MEMBER MELLINGER? WHERE'S THE FAIR OAKS BRIDGE? I'M LOOKING AT GOOGLE MAPS. THE FAIR OAKS BRIDGE GOES OVER THE CALTRAIN TRACKS OVER CALTRAIN. THANK YOU. I THOUGHT IT WAS THE 101 ONE, AND IT WAS LIKE THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT THAT.
YEAH, I'M HAPPY TO CO-SPONSOR CO-SPONSOR, CO-SPONSOR ANY OTHER CO-SPONSORS.
VICE MAYOR GO RIGHT AHEAD. QUESTION QUESTION.
SO HOW DOES THIS RELATE TO THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN? WHY WAS NOT IT NOT INCLUDED IN THE ACTS OF? WAS IT OVERSIGHT? IT WAS NOT INCLUDED. SO THERE WERE, CAN I ASK THIS? CAN I ASK THAT QUESTION?
ABSOLUTELY? OKAY.
I CAN GIVE MY ANSWER. AND THIS IS BASED ON MY MEMORY OF BEING INVOLVED IN THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN PROCESS. THERE WERE IMPROVEMENTS TO FAIR OAKS CALLED OUT IN THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN IN 2,017, WHEN COUNCIL WAS CONSIDERING BIKE LANE INFRASTRUCTURE ON FAIR OAKS. THIS WAS ACTUALLY ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE I GOT INVOLVED IN CITY GOVERNMENT, SO I MISSED THIS ONE.
PREDATING THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION. YES, IT PREDATED THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN SO SPECIFICALLY TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR WE DON'T GO FAR AFIELD. SURE
HOW I'M I'M GOING TO NARROWLY PHRASE THIS AT THE TIME COUNCIL VOTED
TO SPECIFICALLY RETAIN STREET PARKING AND INSTALL SHARROWS ON FAIR OAKS, WHICH HAS SINCE BEEN INTERPRETED AS A STANDING COUNCIL POLICY LIMITING THE KIND OF WORK THAT CAN THE KIND OF TRAFFIC IMPROVEMENTS THAT CAN BE MADE TO FAIR OAKS.
SO TO THE THAT HAD AN IMPACT ON THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN EFFORTS ON FAIR OAKS. THIS IS A
MY, VERY COMPRESSED HISTORY ON THAT.
OKAY? AND ONE LAST THING. SO THIS ONE STUDY ISSUE IS ACTUALLY 3 STUDY ISSUES. THIS IS 3 STUDY ISSUES THAT ARE COPY PASTED. OKAY, OKAY, THANKS. SO I'LL CO-SPONSOR. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
AND ANYTHING ELSE. COUNCILMEMBER WALLINGER.
NO, SIR, THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMOR, LAY NO PROBLEM.
CITY MANAGER.
DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS? NON-AGENDA ITEMS? I DO. I JUST WANT TO REMIND COUNCIL WE HAVE OUR RETREAT THIS THURSDAY.
ABOUT 3 QUARTERS OF A DAY AGO, 8, 30 TO 2 30. SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT. AND I ALSO WANTED TO MAKE A A LITTLE BIT OF A STATEMENT.
REGARDING THE OUR EXPERIENCE WITH THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION'S EXECUTIVE ORDERS. THEY HAVE BEEN COMING FAST AND FURIOUS, AND WE HAVE BEEN DOING OUR BEST. BUT WHAT I'D LIKE TO TO JUST SAY IS.
THEY ARE IN MY OPINION, IN MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION.
DISRUPTIVE, COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. I WANT TO MAKE COUNCIL AWARE THAT THEY ARE OCCUPYING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF STAFF TIME RIGHT NOW IN BOTH THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND WITH MANAGERS AND DIRECTORS ACROSS MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS. THEY'RE CREATING
CONCERN ANXIETY IN THE COMMUNITY BOTH OUR PUB PUB MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC, BUT ALSO WITHIN OUR WORKFORCE.
AND SO WE ARE WORKING TO MANAGE THOSE, BUT AND WE'LL KEEP COUNCIL ABREAST, AND IT IS VERY HELPFUL TO HAVE TOWNSEND ON RIGHT NOW.
BUT THESE EXECUTIVE ORDERS ARE DESIGNED TO DO THIS AND BE CHAOTIC AND DISRUPT.
AND SO WE WILL STAY THE COURSE AND WORK THROUGH THEM, AND KEEP COUNCIL UP TO DATE ON ALL OF THAT. SO JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT WITH EVERYONE. AND AGAIN LOOKING FORWARD TO THURSDAY.
THANK YOU.
AND WITH THAT LET'S MOVE TO ADJOURNMENT. THIS MEETING IS ADJOURNED AT
1027 PM. THANKS TO EVERYONE WHO PARTICIPATED. HAVE A GOOD EVENING.

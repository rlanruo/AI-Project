### **Summary of Key Information**

#### **Key Considerations for Tennis & Pickleball**

-   **Noise & Proximity**: Pickleball generates more noise than tennis, requiring consideration of adjacent residences.
-   **Social & Competitive Differences**: While both are court sports, their social and competitive environments differ.
-   **Court Dimensions**:
    -   Pickleball: 20' x 44' (USA Pickleball standards).
    -   Tennis: 78' x 36' (USTA standards), with doubles alleys.
-   **Overlay Feasibility**:
    -   Pickleball can be nested within tennis courts (but nets differ in height).
    -   Overlaying on basketball courts is possible but depends on lighting/fencing.

#### **Cricket Field Considerations**

-   **Large Footprint Required**: Adult cricket pitch needs ~360' diameter; youth needs ~330'.
-   **Shared Use**: Potential to integrate with multi-use fields (e.g., softball/soccer outfields).
-   **Lighting**: Existing cricket fields (Fair Oaks, Ortega) have partial lighting; new designs propose shared lighting (e.g., Las Palmas Park).

#### **Community Feedback**

-   **Pickleball Overlays**:
    -   Overlaying on tennis courts was **unpopular** (preferred dedicated facilities).
    -   Overlaying on basketball courts received **positive responses** (top locations: Ortega, Washington, Fair Oaks).
-   **Preferred Locations**:
    -   **Pickleball**: De Anza Park (ranked #1), Las Palmas, Ponderosa.
    -   **Tennis**: Las Palmas (#1), De Anza, Ponderosa.
    -   **Cricket**: Las Palmas & Ortega (though "none" was the top response due to concerns from other sports groups).

#### **Site Assessments & Recommendations**

-   **De Anza Park**: Proposed **12 dedicated pickleball courts** (top community choice).
-   **Encinal Park**: Proposed **6 pickleball courts** (ranked #4).
-   **Ponderosa Park**: Proposed **2 dedicated tennis courts** (ranked #3 for tennis).
-   **Las Palmas Park**: Proposed **dedicated tennis courts + cricket pitch** (top choice for tennis/cricket).
-   **Ortega Park**: Refurbish cricket pitch + **pickleball overlay on basketball courts** (top choice for basketball overlay).
-   **Washington Park**: **Pickleball overlay on basketball courts** (limited to 2 courts due to noise concerns).

#### **Cost & Design Factors**

-   **Common Features**: LED lighting, spectator benches, fencing (with sound dampening for pickleball), perimeter pathways.
-   **Key Constraints**: Lighting availability, fencing needs (to contain balls), and noise mitigation.

### **Conclusion**

The study evaluated space, noise, community preferences, and cost to recommend dedicated facilities for pickleball/tennis and shared-use options for cricket, prioritizing parks like De Anza, Las Palmas, and Ortega. Overlays were favored only for pickleball on basketball courts.

### **Summary of Key Information:**

1. **Noise Mitigation & Cost Analysis**:

    - Limited to 4 courts at a location to avoid noise impact on nearby homes.
    - Rough cost estimates provided for facilities, including mobilization, permits, and contingencies.

2. **Cost Breakdowns**:

    - **Pickleball**:
        - 6 courts + lighting: ~$1.1M.
        - Overlay per court (e.g., Washington/Ortega): ~$60K.
    - **Tennis**:
        - 2 courts + lighting: ~$1.05M.
    - **Cricket**:
        - Shared field surface: $30K–$47K.
        - Outfield prep/drainage: ~$634K.
        - Natural grass/irrigation: ~$890K.
        - Lighting (shared): $1.9M–$2.6M.
        - **Total cricket facility**: $3.5M–$4.2M (mostly shared costs).

3. **Recommendations**:

    - **Pickleball**: Dedicated courts at De Anza & Encinall Parks; overlays on basketball courts at Ortega & Washington Parks (latter two later removed per feedback).
    - **Tennis**: Dedicated courts at Las Palmas & Ponderosa Parks.
    - **Cricket**: New pitch at Las Palmas; refurbish existing at Ortega Park.
    - Prioritize Las Palmas Park upgrades (already in design phase); others to align with 20-year Capital Improvement Plan (CIP).

4. **Feedback & Adjustments**:

    - Parks & Rec Commission supported most recommendations but opposed pickleball overlays on basketball courts (removed).
    - Suggestion for broader community outreach before finalizing plans.

5. **Council Concerns**:

    - Requests for data on current facility usage (e.g., Little League, soccer) and cost/benefit for underrepresented sports (e.g., disc golf, lawn bowling).
    - Inquiry about integrating needs into broader park renovation cycles and Baylands Park potential (county-owned, under discussion).

6. **Next Steps**:
    - Further neighborhood-specific outreach.
    - Incorporate feedback into CIP budget planning.
    - Address equity in sports facility distribution (beyond top 3 requested sports).

**Key Themes**: Cost-sharing, phased implementation, community engagement, and balancing high-demand vs. underserved sports.

### Key Points from the Section:

1. **Support for Cricket Facilities**: Strong endorsement for improving cricket pitches at Ortega Park and adding one at Las Palmas Park due to high community demand. Concerns were raised about inaccurate cost estimates (e.g., lighting) and mislabeled cricket locations in the report (e.g., Fair Oaks Park).

2. **Pickleball Concerns**:

    - Hesitation about shared striping for basketball and pickleball courts due to potential user conflicts.
    - Suggestion to relocate proposed pickleball courts at Ensignal Park farther from residences (near an office parking lot) to mitigate noise, with staff confirming a 150-foot buffer from homes.

3. **Tennis Center Coordination**: Request for analysis of how proposed tennis/pickleball additions in other parks align with prior Tennis Center upgrade plans.

4. **Outreach and Data Gaps**:

    - Calls for more engagement with Little League and soccer organizations, though the study’s scope originally focused on pickleball, tennis, and cricket.
    - Requests for detailed park usage data (e.g., reservations, surveys) to prioritize investments.
    - Survey limitations noted (e.g., possible inflation from non-residents; 2,000 responses, mostly from Sunnyvale).

5. **Other Notes**:
    - Interest in adding batting cages and correcting park amenity listings.
    - Staff clarified that outreach included emails to sports groups and registered program participants, but qualitative feedback (comments) was also collected and could be shared.
    - Discussion on balancing diverse sports needs amid limited resources.

**Summary**: The section highlights support for cricket, cautious pickleball planning, and requests for better data and outreach to inform equitable park upgrades. Concerns about noise, space conflicts, and accurate cost projections are recurring themes.
